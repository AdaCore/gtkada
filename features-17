-------------------------

NF-17-J810-010 Improving handling of User_Data

   The following generic packages were modified:
     Gdk.Event.Handler_Set_User_Data
     Gtk.Action_Group.Set_Translate_Func_User_Data
     Gtk.File_Filter.Add_Custom_User_Data
     Gtk.Widget.Add_Tick_Callback_User_Data

   The Notify parameter was removed from the public API. Instead,
   GtkAda will call the Destroy procedure to release User_Data.

NF-17-OC21-020 additions to Gtkada.MDI.Float_Child and Gtkada.MDI.Put

   New parameters allow controlling the position of the child as it is
   being put in the MDI or when it is being floated.

NF-17-P315-053 Make notebook tabs orientation configurable

   New parameter in Gtkada.MDI.Configure allows controlling the orientation of
   the notebook tabs. Varians are Automatic, Horizontal, Bottom_To_Top and
   Top_To_Bottom.
