New features in GtkAda 17
-------------------------

NF-17-P930-028 Gtkada.Canvas_View: inline editing improvements (2016-09-30)

   New signals have been aded:
      Signal_Inline_Editing_Started
      Signal_Inline_Editing_Finished
   New subprograms have been added:
      Set_Editable, Is_Editable
      Inline_Editing_In_Progress
   When an item that is edited interactively by the user is moved, we now
   also move the editing widget (generally a GtkTextView). This text view
   now also inherits the font size and attributes from the edited item.
   End of editing is done via a simple <return>, since the previous
   <ctrl-return> was impossible to guess by the user. Preselect the whole
   text when editing, so that the user can more easily change it all.

NF-17-P722-028 New MDI child signals (2016-07-22)

   New signals have been introduced in the MDI
      Signal_Before_Unfloat_Child
      Signal_Before_Destroy_Child
   allowing respectively to react before a child is unfloated or destroyed.

NF-17-P315-053 Make notebook tabs orientation configurable (2016-03-18)

   New parameter in Gtkada.MDI.Configure allows controlling the orientation of
   the notebook tabs. Varians are Automatic, Horizontal, Bottom_To_Top and
   Top_To_Bottom.

NF-17-OC21-020 Additions to Float_Child and Put in Gtkada.MDI (2016-03-08)

   New parameters allow controlling the position of the child as it is
   being put in the MDI or when it is being floated.

NF-17-J810-010 Improving handling of User_Data (2016-04-15)

   The following generic packages were modified:
     Gdk.Event.Handler_Set_User_Data
     Gtk.Action_Group.Set_Translate_Func_User_Data
     Gtk.File_Filter.Add_Custom_User_Data
     Gtk.Widget.Add_Tick_Callback_User_Data

   The Notify parameter was removed from the public API. Instead,
   GtkAda will call the Destroy procedure to release User_Data.
