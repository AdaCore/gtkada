--  <description>
--
--  This package implements a generic double-linked list.
--  Such lists are used throughout GtkAda to contain lists of widgets
--  (for the children of containers, or for the list of selected widgets
--  in a Gtk_Clist for instance), list of strings (for Gtk_Combo_Box),...
--
--  They provide a common interface to traverse these lists.
--
--  One useful note: you should only Free the lists that you have allocated
--  yourself, and not the lists that are returned by the subprograms in
--  GtkAda and should be left under GtkAda's control.
--
--  See the example below for an example on how to traverse a list.
--
--  Instantiating the package Generic_List requires two functions to convert
--  back and forth between your data type and a System.Address which is the
--  type stored at the C level.
--  Note that the lists used in GtkAda already have associated packages, like
--  Gtk.Enums.Gint_List, Gtk.Enums.String_List or Gtk.Widget.Widget_List.

      --  This item isn't associated with any data.
      --  You probably don't have to use this subprogram, since Append,
      --  Insert, Prepend, etc. already handle the allocation for you and
      --  give a new value to the item.

      procedure Append (List : in out Glist; Data : Gpointer);

      --  directly back in List.

      --  List2 is added at the end of List1.

      --  If Position is 0, the item is added at the beginning of the list, if
      --  it is negative the item is added at the end.

      function Find (List : Glist; Data : Gpointer) return Glist;
      --  Find a value in the list, and return the first item that contains it.

      --  This only frees the memory associated with the list itself.
      --  You should only use this function on the lists that
      --  you have created yourself, not on the list that are returned by some
      --  functions in GtkAda (like Gtk.Clist.Get_Selection). These functions
      --  return directly the list managed by the underlying C widget, and you
      --  should never free the result yourself.
      --
      --  Note also that the memory might not be actually freed. For efficiency
      --  reasons, GtkAda will keep the memory allocated and try to reuse it as
      --  much as possible.

      --  of each cell, but rather at each cell. In such cases,

      --  the address of the cell itself, insted of the address
      --  pointed to by data.

      --  Return the Data contained in the N-th item of List.
      --  The result is undefined if there is no such item in the list.
      --  The actual result in that case is the result of
      --      Convert (System.Null_Address);
      --  which might not mean anything.

      function Position (List : Glist; Link : Glist) return Gint;
      --  Return the position of Link in the List.
      --  If Link is not contained in the list, -1 is returned.
