--  Gdk_Display objects purpose are two fold:
--     - To grab/ungrab keyboard focus and mouse pointer
--     - To manage and provide information about the Gdk_Screen(s) available
--       for this Gdk_Display
--  Gdk_Display objects are the GDK representation of the X Display which can
--  be described as a workstation consisting of a keyboard a pointing device
--  (such as a mouse) and one or more screens. It is used to open and keep
--  track of various Gdk_Screen objects currently instanciated by the
--  application. It is also used to grab and release the keyboard and the mouse
--  pointer.
