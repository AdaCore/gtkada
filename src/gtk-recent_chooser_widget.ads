--  <description>
--  Gtk_Recent_Chooser_Widget is a widget suitable for selecting recently used
--  files. It is the main building block of a Gtk_Recent_Chooser_Dialog. Most
--  applications will only need to use the latter; you can use
--  Gtk_Recent_Chooser_Widget as part of a larger window if you have special
--  needs.
--
--  Note that Gtk_Recent_Chooser_Widget does not have any methods of its own.
--  Instead, you should use the functions that work on a Gtk_Recent_Chooser.
--
--  Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.
