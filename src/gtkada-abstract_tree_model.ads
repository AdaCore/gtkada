   --  based model would not want to keep the entire file-hierarchy in memory,
   --  just the sections that are currently being displayed by every current
   --  view.
   --  Technically, the idea is to increase the refcount for the node itself,
   --  not for any data associated with it (should you want to associate a
   --  reference counted type with the rows). Most of the time you will not
   --  need to do anything here.
   --  Every time the view makes a row visible (for instance when you expand
   --  a node), it calls Ref_Node for that row. When the row is hidden again,
   --  it calls Unref_Node.

   --  This is an optional method for models to implement. To be more specific,
   --  models may ignore this call as it exists primarily for performance
   --  reasons. For more information on what this means, please see
   --  Tree_Model_Ref_Node. Please note that nodes that are deleted are not
   --  unreferenced.
   --  Technically, your model is the one deleting a row (and it should do so
   --  only if the refcount for the row is not 1, see Ref_Node). Thus gtk+
   --  avoids a potential callback to your application by not emitting
   --  Unref_Node in such a case.
