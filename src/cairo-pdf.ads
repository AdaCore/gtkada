package Cairo.PDF is

   function Create
     (Filename         : String;
      Width_In_Points  : Gdouble;
      Height_In_Points : Gdouble) return Cairo_Surface;
   --  Creates a PDF surface of the specified size in points to be written to
   --  filename.
   --
   --  filename :
   --   a filename for the PDF output (must be writable), NULL may be used to
   --   specify no output. This will generate a PDF surface that may be queried
   --   and used as a source, without generating a temporary file.
   --  width_in_points:
   --   width of the surface, in points (1 point == 1/72.0 inch)
   --  height_in_points:
   --   height of the surface, in points (1 point == 1/72.0 inch)
   --  Returns:
   --   a pointer to the newly created surface. The caller owns the surface and
   --   should call cairo_surface_destroy() when done with it. This function
   --   always returns a valid pointer, but it will return a pointer to a "nil"
   --   surface if an error such as out of memory occurs. You can use
   --   cairo_surface_status() to check for this.

   --  Since 1.2
