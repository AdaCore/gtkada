--  <description>
--  This package contains low-level subprograms that are used to interact or
--  configure the main loop.
--  This loop is responsible for processing events, monitoring input sources
--  like pipes, sockets,..., and calling callbacks at given time intervals.
--  New event sources can be created.
--
--  To allow multiple independent sets of sources to be handled in different
--  threads, each source is associated with a main context. A main context can
--  only be running in a single thread, but sources can be added to it and
--  removed from it from other threads.
--
--  Each event source is assigned a priority. The default priority,
--  G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, is 0. Values less than 0 denote higher priorities.
--  Values greater than 0 denote lower priorities. Events from high priority
--  sources are always processed before events from lower priority sources.
--
--  Idle functions can also be added, and assigned a priority. These will be
--  run whenever no events with a higher priority are ready to be processed.
--
--  The GMainLoop data type represents a main event loop. A GMainLoop is
--  created with g_main_loop_new(). After adding the initial event sources,
--  g_main_loop_run() is called. This continuously checks for new events from
--  each of the event sources and dispatches them. Finally, the processing of
--  an event from one of the sources leads to a call to g_main_loop_quit() to
--  exit the main loop, and g_main_loop_run() returns.

--  It is possible to create new instances of GMainLoop recursively. This is
--  often used in GTK+ applications when showing modal dialog boxes. Note that
--  event sources are associated with a particular GMainContext, and will be
--  checked and dispatched for all main loops associated with that
--  GMainContext.
--
--  Creating new sources types
--  ==========================
--
--  One of the unusual features of the GTK+ main loop functionality is that new
--  types of event source can be created and used in addition to the builtin
--  type of event source. A new event source type is used for handling GDK
--  events.
--
--  New source types basically interact with with the main context in two ways.
--  Their prepare function in GSourceFuncs can set a timeout to determine the
--  maximum amount of time that the main loop will sleep before checking the
--  source again. In addition, or as well, the source can add file descriptors
--  to the set that the main context checks using g_source_add_poll().
--
--  Ada
--  ===
--
--  Some of these features duplicate Ada builtin tasking support, but the
--  latter might be more complex to use in the context of a graphical
--  application, since most of the time the windowing system doesn't support
--  multi-threaded applications.

   --------------------

   type G_Main_Context is new Glib.C_Proxy;
   --  This type represents a set of sources to handled in the main loop.
   --  Basically, this represents a main loop. There might be several main

   --  identified as the default main context.

   function Main_Context_New return G_Main_Context;
   --  Create a new context

   procedure Main_Context_Ref   (Context : G_Main_Context);
   procedure Main_Context_Unref (Context : G_Main_Context);
   --  Increase or decreate the reference counting for Context. When this
   --  reaches 0, the memory is freed.

   function Main_Context_Default return G_Main_Context;
   --  Returns the default main context. This is the main context used for main
   --  loop functions when a main loop is not explicitly specified.

   procedure Wakeup (Context : G_Main_Context);
   --  If context is currently waiting in a poll(), interrupt the poll(), and
   --  continue the iteration process.

   function Acquire (Context : G_Main_Context) return Boolean;
   --  Tries to become the owner of the specified context. If some other thread
   --  is the owner of the context, returns FALSE immediately. Ownership is
   --  properly recursive: the owner can require ownership again and will
   --  release ownership when Release() is called as many times as Acquire().
   --  You must be the owner of a context before you can call Prepare(),
   --  Query(), Check(), Dispatch().

   procedure Release (Context : G_Main_Context);
   --  Releases ownership of a context previously acquired by this thread with

   --  Determines whether this thread holds the (recursive) ownership of this

   --------------

   type G_Source is new Glib.C_Proxy;
   --  This type represents an event source that can be monitored by the main
   --  loop. There are various internal types of such sources, that can be
   --  configured by setting appropriate callbacks (this is not yet doable in
   --  GtkAda). See Idle_Source_New and Timeout_Source_New.

   type G_Source_Id is new Guint;
   --  The ID of a source within the context to which it is attached.

   type G_Source_Func is access function return Boolean;

   type Source_Prepare_Func is access
     function (Source : G_Source; Timeout : access Gint) return Gboolean;
   pragma Convention (C, Source_Prepare_Func);
   --  Called before all the file descriptors are polled. If the source can
   --  determine that it is ready here (without waiting for the results of the
   --  poll() call) it should return TRUE. It can also return a timeout value
   --  which should be the maximum timeout (in milliseconds) which should be
   --  passed to the poll() call. The actual timeout used will be -1 if all
   --  sources returned -1, or it will be the minimum of all the timeout_
   --  values returned which were >= 0.

   type Source_Check_Func is access
     function (Source : G_Source) return Gboolean;
   pragma Convention (C, Source_Check_Func);
   --  Called after all the file descriptors are polled. The source should
   --  return TRUE if it is ready to be dispatched. Note that some time may
   --  have passed since the previous prepare function was called, so the
   --  source should be checked again here.

   type G_Source_Func_User_Data is access
     function (User_Data : System.Address) return Gboolean;
   pragma Convention (C, G_Source_Func_User_Data);
   --  A callback for a G_Source. If it returns False, the source will be
   --  removed and no longer executed. User_Data is the data passed to
   --  Set_Callback.

   type Source_Dispatch_Func is access
     function (Source   : G_Source;
               Callback : G_Source_Func_User_Data;

   pragma Convention (C, Source_Dispatch_Func);
   --  Called to dispatch the event source, after it has returned TRUE in
   --  either its prepare or its check function. The dispatch function is
   --  passed in a callback function and data. The callback function may be
   --  NULL if the source was never connected to a callback using
   --  Set_Callback().
   --  In C, the exact profile of Callback depends on the type of Source. This
   --  is not possible in Ada, which expects a precise profile.

      return Gboolean;
   pragma Convention (C, Default_Dispatch);
   --  Default implementation for the dispatch callback for sources. This
   --  simply calls Cb and pass it Data.

   type Source_Finalize_Func is access procedure (Source : G_Source);

   --  Create a new type of sources.
   --  This function is specific to GtkAda. The returned value is never
   --  freed. Most of the time, you do not need to create a new source type,
   --  or even call Source_New. Most things can be implemented through the
   --  careful use of Idle and Timeout callbacks. However, creating a new
   --  source type allows for cleaner code, by sharing the common part of the
   --  handling.
   --
   --  For idle sources, the prepare and check functions always return TRUE to
   --  indicate that the source is always ready to be processed. The prepare
   --  function also returns a timeout value of 0 to ensure that the poll()
   --  call doesn't block (since that would be time wasted which could have
   --  been spent running the idle function).
   --
   --  For timeout sources, the prepare and check functions both return TRUE if
   --  the timeout interval has expired. The prepare function also returns a
   --  timeout value to ensure that the poll() call doesn't block too long and
   --  miss the next timeout.
   --
   --  For file descriptor sources, the prepare function typically returns
   --  FALSE, since it must wait until poll() has been called before it knows
   --  whether any events need to be processed. It sets the returned timeout to
   --  -1 to indicate that it doesn't mind how long the poll() call blocks. In
   --  the check function, it tests the results of the poll() call to see if
   --  the required condition has been met, and returns TRUE if so.
