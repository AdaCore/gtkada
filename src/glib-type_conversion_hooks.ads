--  <description>
--
--  This package provides an implementation for hooks used in
--  Gtk.Type_Conversion. These hooks should be used when you import a new
--  C GObject, so that GtkAda can recreate the Ada structure from the
--  underlying C structure.
--  Note that when you create a GObject directly in Ada, you do not need to
--  provide any hook.
--
--  Implementation note: This is a separate package from Gtk.Type_Conversion
--  so that adding a hook does not necessarily mean the user has to 'with'
--  Gtk.Type_Conversion, and thus all the packages from GtkAda.
--
--  Note that this package is not thread safe. You should call the
--  function Add_Hook from the elaboration part of your packages.

package Glib.Type_Conversion_Hooks is

   function Conversion_Function
     (Obj : System.Address; Stub : GObject_Record'Class) return GObject;
   --  This function has to convert a C object to an Ada object.
   --  It will first try all the registered functions (in
   --  Glib.Type_Conversion_Hooks). If no match is found, then it will try
   --  recursively all parents of the C object. If no match is found at all,
   --  it will create an object of type Expected_Type, no matter what the real
   --  C type is.

   type Get_GType_Func is access function return Glib.GType;
   pragma Convention (C, Get_GType_Func);
   --  Type used during the type conversion process

   type Conversion_Creator_Hook_Type is

   --  This package is used to allow automatic conversion from a C gtk object
   --  to Ada.
   --  To allow GtkAda to automatically bind an incoming externally created
   --  widget to the correct Ada type, you just need to instantiate this
   --  package, that will then automatically register the appropriate
   --  conversion methods.
   generic

      --  This function returns the GType assiciated with the type we want to
      --  convert to. Usually, all widgets have a class-wide Get_Type that can
      --  directly be used here.

      type Handled_Type is new GObject_Record with private;
      --  The type we want to convert to.

   package Hook_Registrator is

      function Creator (Expected_Object : GObject_Record'Class) return GObject;
      --  This function will create an Ada type corresponding to Handled_Type.
      --  In case Expected_Object is a child type of Handled_Type, an Ada
      --  object of type Expected_Object is returned instead.
      --
      --  This allows convertion of types we know are expected, but don't have
      --  registered conversion hook functions.

      --  We need to create this access type here because of RM 3.10.2(28)
      --  It should go to the body, but conversion of Creator'Access to
      --  Conversion_Creator_Hook_Type is only allowed in the private section.
