--  General implementation for a graph.
--  This provides a representation for a graph structure, with nodes (vertices)
--  connected by links (edges).
--  It is not intended for huges, highly-connected graphs, since there are
--  several lists provided for efficient access to ancestor and children nodes.

   --------------------------

      Predecessor : Vertex_Access;
   end record;
   --  Distance is the shortest distance from the root of the breadth-first
   --  search to Vertex. The graph is considered as unweighted. Thus, Distance
   --  is 1 for direct children of Root, 2 for grand-children,...
   --  Predecessor is the parent of Vertex used when computing the distance.

   function Breadth_First_Search (G : Graph; Root : access Vertex'Class)
      return Breadth_Vertices_Array;
   --  Traverse the tree Breadth_First, and sort the nodes accordingly.
   --  The returned list is sorted so that all nodes at a distance k from Root
   --  are found before the nodes at a distance (k+1).
   --  The running time is O(vertices + edges).

   ------------------------
   -- Depth First Search --
   ------------------------
   --  This algorithm traverse the tree in depth, ie all the descendents of the
   --  first child are found before the second child.
   --  This algorithm has several properties: it can indicate whether the graph
   --  is cyclic. Moreover, the subgraph formed by all the nodes and the edges
   --  between a vertex and its predecessor (see the structure Depth_Record) is
   --  a tree.
   --  If the graph is acyclic, then the resulting array is sorted
   --  topologically: if G contains an edge (u, v), then u appears before v.
   --
   --  The running time for this algorithm is O(vertices + edges)

   type Depth_Record is record

      First_Discovered, End_Search : Natural;
      Predecessor : Vertex_Access;
   end record;
   --  First_Discovered and End_Search are the two timestamps computed during
   --  the search. The former is the time Vertex was first discovered. The
   --  latter is the time when all the children of vertex were fully
   --  processed.
   --  Predecessor is the parent of Vertex.

   type Depth_Vertices_Array is array (Natural range <>) of Depth_Record;

   type Reverse_Edge_Callback is access

   --  to make the graph acyclick

      return Depth_Vertices_Array;
   --  Same as above, but Acyclic is also modified to indicate whether G is
   --  acyclic.
   --  If Reverse_Edge_Cb is not null, then it is called to reverse the ends of
   --  selected edges, so that the final graph is acyclic. Note that you *must*
   --  revert the ends, or there will be an infinite loop. You might also want
   --  to mark the edge as reverted somehow, so as to draw the arrows on the
   --  correct side, if your application is graphical.
   --
   --  If Reverse_Edge_Cb is null, no edge is reverted, and the graph is
   --  unmodified.

   -----------------------------------
   -- Strongly connected components --
   -----------------------------------
   --  Strongly connected components in a directed graph are the maximal set of
   --  vertices such that for every pair {u, v} of vertices in the set, there
   --  exist a path from u to v and a path from v to u.
   --  Two vertices are in different strongly connected components if there
   --  exist at most one of these paths.

   --  Free the list of strongly connected components

   function Strongly_Connected_Components (G : Graph)
      return Connected_Component_List;
   --  Return the list of strongly connected components.
   --  This is a linear time algorithm O(vertices + edges).

   function Strongly_Connected_Components
     (G : Graph; DFS : Depth_Vertices_Array)
      return Connected_Component_List;
   --  Same as above, but a depth-first search has already been run on G, and
   --  we reuse the result. This is of course more efficient than the previous
   --  function.

   ----------------------------
   -- Minimum spanning trees --
   ----------------------------
   --  A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of G that forms a
   --  tree (acyclic) and connects all the vertices of G.
   --  Note that the number of edges in the resulting tree is always
   --      (number of vertices of G) - 1

   function Kruskal (G : Graph) return Edges_Array;
   --  Return a minimum spanning tree of G using Kruskal's algorithm.
   --  This algorithm runs in O(E * log E), with E = number of edges.

   ---------------------

   function First (G : Graph) return Vertex_Iterator;
   --  Return a pointer to the first vertex.

   procedure Next (V : in out Vertex_Iterator);
   --  Moves V to the next vertex in the graph.

   function At_End (V : Vertex_Iterator) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if V points after the last vertex

   function Get (V : Vertex_Iterator) return Vertex_Access;
   --  Get the vertex pointed to by V

   -------------------

   -------------------

      Directed : Boolean := True)
      return Edge_Iterator;
   --  Return a pointer to the first edge from Src to Dest.
   --  If either Src or Dest is null, then any vertex matches. Thus, if both
   --  parameters are nulll, this iterator will traverse the whole graph.
   --  Note: there might be duplicates returned by this iterator, especially
   --  when the graph is not oriented.
   --  Directed can be used to temporarily overrides the setting in the graph:
   --  If Directed is True, the setting of G is taken into account.
   --  If Directed is False, the setting of G is ignored, and the graph is
   --  considered as not directed.

   procedure Next (E : in out Edge_Iterator);
   --  Moves V to the next edge in the graph.

   function At_End (E : Edge_Iterator) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if V points after the last edge

   function Get (E : Edge_Iterator) return Edge_Access;
   --  Get the edge pointed to by E.

   function Repeat_Count (E : Edge_Iterator) return Positive;
   --  Return the number of similar edges (same ends) that were found before,
   --  and including this one).
   --  For instance, if there two edges from A to B, then the first one will
   --  have a Repeat_Count of 1, and the second 2.
