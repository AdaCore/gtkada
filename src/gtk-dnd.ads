--  <description>
--  Like all modern GUI toolkits, GtkAda has a full support for drag-and-drop
--  operations. This is a mechanism for interactively transferring data between
--  two widgets, either in the same application or in two different
--  applications. The user clicks on a widget (called a "drag source"), and,
--  while keeping the mouse button pressed, moves it to another widget, where
--  the mouse button is released (this other widget is called a "drop site").
--  As a result, and if both widgets can handle the same type of data, some
--  data is either copied or moved to this new widget.
--
--  This is a very intuitive way, in some cases, to enhance the usability of
--  your application, although you should carefully consider whether this
--  should be used or not.
--
--  GtkAda supports several drag-and-drop protocols, so as to be able to
--  communicate with the maximum number of applications. These protocols are
--  Xdnd and Motif.
--
--  Below is a summary of what is needed to add drag-and-drop capabilities to
--  your application. We highly recommend that you look at, and understand,
--  the example in testgtk (create_dnd.adb), before using these features in
--  your own application.
--
--  See also the package Gtk.Selection, that contains some lower subprograms
--  and data types that are used when implementing drag-and-drop.
--
--  - Defining a widget as a possible drag source
--
--  You need to call Source_Set, specifying which mouse buttons can activate
--  the drag, which types of data will be given, and which kind of action
--  will be performed.
--  You then need to connect to the signal "drag_data_get", that will be
--  emitted when the user has dropped the item and GtkAda needs to find the
--  data. You must call Selection_Data_Set in the handler to set the actual
--  data.
--  You can also connect the widget to "drag_data_delete", which will be
--  called whenever the data set for the selection is no longer required and
--  should be deleted. The signal will be emitted only if the drop site
--  requests it, or if the selected action for the drag-and-drop operation
--  was Action_Move. It will not be called automatically for an Action_Copy.
--  Note that the callback might be called several times, if for instance this
--  was an Action_Move, and the drop site requires explicitly to delete the
--  data in its call to Finish.
--
--  - Defining a widget as a possible drop site
--
--  You need to call Dest_Set, specifying which types of Data are accepted
--  by the widget, which actions are recognized, and whether you accept drops
--  from external applications.
--  You also need to connect to "drag_data_received", that will be emitted
--  when the user has dropped some data on the widget. The handler should
--  call Finish, to warn the source widget that the drag and drop operation
--  is finished, and whether it was successful or not.

   -- Signals --
   -------------

   --  <signals>
   --  The following new signals are defined for the class
   --  Gtk.Widget.Gtk_Widget to support drag-and-drop.
   --  Please note that no default marshaller is provided in GtkAda for these
   --  handlers, and that you will have to use the general form of callbacks
   --  instead, getting the value of the parameters directly from the
   --  Gtk_Args structure.
   --
   --  - "drag_begin"   (source side)
   --    procedure Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;
   --                       Context : Drag_Context);
   --
   --    A new drag-and-drop operation has just been started from Widget. This
   --    callback can be used for instance to modify the visual aspect of the
   --    widget, so as to give a visual clue as to what widget is the source.
   --
   --  - "drag_end"     (source side)
   --    procedure Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;
   --                       Context : Drag_Context);
   --
   --    The drag-and-drop operation that was started from the widget has been
   --    completed, and the standard set of the widget can be restored.
   --
   --  - "drag_data_get"  (source side)
   --    procedure Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;
   --                       Context : Drag_Context;
   --                       Data    : Selection_Data;

   --                       Time    : Guint);
   --
   --    This should be connected to every drag source.
   --    This is used to request the actual data to be transfered to the drop
   --    site once the drop has been done.
   --    Info is the type of the expected Data, and is in fact the third
   --    field of the Target_Entry record, whose value you have define
   --    yourself.
   --    Data should be modified to include a pointer or a copy of the data,
   --    through Selection_Data_Set.
   --
   --  - "drag_data_delete"  (source side)
   --    procedure Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;
   --                       Context : Drag_Context);
   --
   --    This handler is called whenever the drop site of a drag-and-drop
   --    operation has decided that the data should be deleted, or
   --    automaticallyif the selected action was Action_Move.
   --    Widget is the drag source.
   --
   --  - "drag_leave"  (target side)
   --    procedure Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;
   --                       Context : Drag_Context;
   --                       Time    : Guint);

   --    Signal emitted whenever a drag-and-drop operation is being performed,
   --    and the mouse has just left the area covered by a widget on the
   --    screen. This can be used to restore the default visual aspect of the
   --    widget. This is also emitted when the drop has been performed on the
   --    widget.
   --
   --  - "drag_motion"  (target side)
   --    function Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;

   --
   --    This is called every time the user is doing a dnd operation, and
   --    the mouse is currently over Widget (but not released yet).
   --    This can be used to change the visual aspect of Widget to provide
   --    visual clues to the user. The "opposite" signal is drag_leave.
   --
   --    The return value is ignored if Dest_Default_Motion was set when
   --    Source_Set was called. This handler should return True if Widget
   --    acknowledges that it is a possible drop site for the particular
   --    targets provided by the drag source.
   --
   --  - "drag_drop"  (target side)
   --    function Handler (Widget  : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class;

   --    This is called whenever a drop is about to be performed on the widget.
   --    Note that this is called even if no common target type has been found
   --    between the drag source and the drop site. Thus, you will need to
   --    analyze the result of Get_Targets (Context) to find the possible
   --    targets.
   --    The data is sent separately through the "drag_data_received" signal,
   --    and might not even be available when "drag_drop" is emitted.
   --    This signal is mostly used if you have chosen not to use any of the
   --    default behavior when calling Dest_Set. Otherwise, everything is
   --    already handled directly by GtkAda.
   --
   --    This handler should return True if Widget acknowledges that it is a
   --    possible drop site for the particular targets provided by the drag
   --    source.

   --    This signal should be connected to every drop site.
   --    The handler is called every time some new data has been dropped onto
   --    Widget. (X, Y) are the mouse coordinates, relative to the widget's
   --    window, where the data was dropped. Info is the type of the data,
   --    has set in the third field of the Target_Entry record, and Data
   --    contains a pointer to the actual data.
