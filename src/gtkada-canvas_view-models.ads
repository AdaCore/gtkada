   ------------
   -- Rtrees --
   ------------
   --  A wrapper around another model, which provides efficient geospatial
   --  queries, like finding the smaller enclosing rectangle for all the
   --  items, or all the items within a given region.
   --  The items are stored in the base model, and the Rtree model adds
   --  an extra data structure on top of it to speed up the queries.
   --  When new items are added to the model, Refresh_Layout *must* be
   --  called to refresh the internal cache (but this should always be done
   --  in any case to refresh the display of links for instance).
   --
   --  Wrapping a model in a Rtree means that the speed of displaying the
   --  canvas (and more importantly scrolling it) now depends on the number
   --  of items on the screen, not the total number of items in the model).
   --  As a result, it is possible to have models with hundreds of
   --  thousands of items.

      type Base_Model_Record is new Canvas_Model_Record with private;

      --  provides support for Add and Remove), and for which the Rtree
