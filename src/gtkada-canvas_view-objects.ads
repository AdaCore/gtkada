--  Various support utilities for the drawing of objects in GtkAda.Canvas

package Gtkada.Canvas_View.Objects is

   function Toplevel
     (Self : not null access Abstract_Item_Record'Class)
      return Abstract_Item;
   --  Return the top-most container for Self, or null

   function Link_Anchor_Point
     (Self   : not null access Abstract_Item_Record'Class;
      Anchor : Anchor_Attachment)
      return Item_Point;
   --  Implementation helper for an object's Link_Anchor_Point primitive.
   --  This uses the bounding-box of the object to compute the middle point,
   --  which works fine on most cases, except for objects where link
   --  attachment is constrained to a small section of the object.

end Gtkada.Canvas_View.Objects;
