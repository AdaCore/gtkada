   --  will put it back in the MDI instead of destroying it (unless its flag
   --  Always_Destroy_Float is set).
   --  Title_Font is the font used in the title bars (if null, "sans 8"
   --  is used).
   --  The colors, when Null_Color, will not change the current setup.
   --  If Draw_Title_Bars is False, then no extra title bar will be displayed
   --  for the MDI children when they are maximized. This saves space on the
   --  screen. However, the notebook tabs will be highlighted with
   --  Title_Bar_Color in exchange.
   --  Tabs_Position indicates where the notebook tabs should be put.
   --  Show_Tabs_Policy indicates when the notebook tabs should be displayed.
   --
   --  If Homogeneous_Tabs is true, then the notebook tabs will only use their
   --  natural size when they all fit in the notebook's width. Otherwise, they
   --  are resized (and ellipsized as needed) so that more of them show.
   --  Changing this setup requires a restart of the MDI.
   --
   --  Calling configure will define a default CSS to properly theme the MDI.
   --  This CSS relies on mainly two widget classes to behave:
   --  * mdifocused, corresponding to the notebook having the focus
   --  * mdititle, corresponding to the title bar
   --  This default CSS renders the active tab of the active notebook with the
   --  color defined in Focus_Title_Color. Same for the color of the title
   --  bar (uses Title_Bar_Color for non-active title bar).
   --  This behavior can at any point be overriden by users by defining
   --  their own and load it at run-time.
   --
   --  Since the move to gtk3, the highlighting of the current tab is left to
   --  the gtk+ theme, rather than overwritten in this package. This permits a
   --  better integration with the user's theme. It is possible for
   --  applications to provide their own CSS, though, using
   --  Gtkada.Style.Load_Css_File. Here is an example of such a CSS, which
   --  highlights the current tab in the notebook that currently has the focus:
   --
   --     @define-color mdi-tab-color  grey;
   --     @define-color mdi-active-tab-color blue;
   --     .mdititle {
   --         border-width: 2px;
   --         background-image: -gtk-gradient(
   --             linear, left top, left bottom,
   --             from(@mdi-tab-color), to(shade(@mdi-tab-color, 1.1)));
   --     }
   --     .mdifocused .mdititle {
   --         background-image: -gtk-gradient(
   --             linear, left top, left bottom,
   --             from(@mdi-active-tab-color),
   --             to(shade(@mdi-active-tab-color, 1.1)));
   --     .mdi tab GtkLabel, .mdi tab GtkImage { opacity: 0.8 }
   --     .mdifocused tab GtkLabel, .mdifocused tab GtkImage { opacity: 1.0}

   --  Special flags to set up the widgets:
   --  The first is the buttons that should be displayed in the title
   --  bar of the MDI children.
   --  If Float_As_Transient is set, then the child will be set up as a
   --  transient window when floating: on most window managers, it will stay on
   --  top of the MDI, but the window will have less decorations in its title
   --  bar, in particular no destroy button. In such a case, <Esc> will close
   --  the window, or unfloat it depending on the MDI's setup, as is the case
   --  for all dialogs in GtkAda. The MDI's setup will be ignored (and the
   --  child always destroyed when Esc is pressed) if Always_Destroy_Float is
   --  true.

   type Child_Group is new Positive;
   Group_Default : constant Child_Group := 1;
   Group_Any     : constant Child_Group := Child_Group'Last;
   --  This type can be used to help group windows by type within the MDI.
   --  Group_Default as a special status when computing the initial position
   --  for a window. But you can create your own groups as needed, so that for
   --  instance editors tend to be grouped with other editors, graphs with
   --  other graphs,... depending on your application.
   --  The group has an impact when the last window from a notebook is closed:
   --  If the window belongs to Group_Default, and it is the last of its group,
   --  then the space currently occupied by that window is not reclaimed, and
   --  therefore an empty area will exist in the MDI. The idea is that for
   --  instance editors typically play a special role in an integrated
   --  development environment, and the users like to have them in the center
   --  of the window. When closing the last editor, they do not want the side
   --  windows (browsers, consoles,...) to take up that space that should
   --  really only be used for editors.
   --  To get such a behavior, editors should belong to Group_Default, and all
   --  other windows to custom groups.
   --
   --  Do not use Group_Any, it is used internally with special meanings.

   --  Move_To_Next indicates whether we want to select the next child (True)
   --  or the previous child (False).
   --  This dialog will be closed only when the key that opened it is fully
   --  released. For instance, if the dialog was opened as a result of
   --  pressing Ctrl-Tab, the dialog will only be closed when Ctrl itself is
   --  released.
   --  You can call this procedure even if a dialog is currently open. This
   --  simply forces a move to the next or previous child. In fact, it is
   --  your responsability to call this procedure when the user presses
   --  the keys to move between children.
   --
   --  If Event is null, then no dialog is displayed. Instead, the next or
   --  previous visible child is immediately selected. In such a mode, windows
   --  that are not on top of their respective notebook are ignored. This can
   --  be used to emulate Emacs's behavior for goto-other-window.
   --
   --  If Only_Group is specified, then only the windows from that group will
   --  be shown in the dialog.

   --  This function is not internal to the MDI since connecting to the
   --  key_press_event and key_release_event should be done in the gtk_window
   --  that contains the MDI. Otherwise, some events are intercepted by gtk+,
   --  for instance the key_release_events, and the key_press_events for some
   --  specified keys.
   --  It also gives the choice to the application of whether this feature is
   --  wanted or not.

   -- Desktop Handling --
   ----------------------
   --  The MDI provides a way to save desktops, i.e the list of children
   --  currently open in the MDI and their location. It can then restore the
   --  desktop at some later point.
   --
   --  Desktops require support from the widgets that are put in the MDI. They
   --  need to register a function to save them and a function to recreate
   --  them. Using Ada streams for this didn't prove workable since some
   --  children might need extra parameters not available to them through
   --  streams. This is why the following subprograms are in a generic package,
   --  so that you can pass whatever parameter(s) is needed in your
   --  application.
   --
   --  Desktops are saved and restored in XML trees.
   --
   --  If you need your application to load a "default desktop" when the user
   --  hasn't defined one, it is recommended that you distribute an actual
   --  file containing this desktop. You could also create the XML tree in
   --  memory yourself, and thus hard-code the default desktop if need be.

   --    procedure Handler
   --       (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class; Child : System.Address);
   --
   --    This signal is emitted when a new child has gained the focus. Convert
   --    Child to a MDI_Child by calling Gtk.Arguments.To_Object. This can be
   --    used to change some global information at the MDI level. You should
   --    connect to "selected" (see below) instead if you want to change some
   --    information at the child level.
   --    Child might be null if no child has the focus anymore
   --
   --  - "float_child"
   --    procedure Handler
   --       (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class; Child : System.Address);
   --
   --    A child was set as floating in the MDI. A similar signal is emitted on
   --    the child itself.
   --
   --  - "child_title_changed"
   --    procedure Handler
   --      (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class; Child : System.Address);
   --
   --    Emitted when the title of a child is changed. This signal is not
   --    emitted if Set_Title is called for a child that hasn't been put in the
   --    MDI yet.
   --
   --  - "child_added"
   --     procedure Handler
   --       (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class; Child : System.Address);
   --     Emitted when a new child is added. You cannot use the "add" signal
   --     since in fact the children are added to notebooks that are part of
   --     the MDI, and thus "add" is only emitted when a new notebook is
   --     created.
   --
   --  - "child_removed"
   --     procedure Handler
   --       (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class; Child : System.Address);
   --     Emitted when a new child is removed. You cannot use the "remove"
   --     signal since in fact the children are removed from notebooks that are
   --     part of the MDI, and thus "remove" is only emitted when a new
   --     notebook is destroyed.
   --     When this signal is emitted, Child no longer contains a widget, and
   --     is no longer part of the children, although you can still access its
   --     titles.
   --
   --  - "child_icon_changed"
   --     procedure Handler
   --       (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class; Child : System.Address);
   --     Emitted when the icon for Child has changed
   --
   --  - "children_reorganized"
   --     procedure Handler (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class);
   --     Emitted when the children have been reorganized: either a split
   --     occurred, or a window was dropped into another position
   --
   --  - "perspective_changed"
   --     procedure Handler (MDI : access MDI_Window_Record'Class);
   --     Called when the user has selected a new perspective. One use is to
   --     save the new desktop to a file.

   --
   --    This signal is emitted for each item in the MDI window before it is
   --    actually deleted. The child is destroyed only if the handler returns
   --    False.
   --    Note that the Child passed in argument is exactly the one you passed
   --    to Put to insert it in the MDI window.
   --    Note that this is also the signal to use to prevent top level
   --    Gtk_Window from being destroyed.
   --
   --  - "selected"
   --    procedure Handler (Child : access MDI_Child_Record'Class);
   --
   --    This is emitted when the child is selected, ie gains the
   --    MDI focus. You should probably also connect to the "grab_focus" signal
   --    to be informed when the child gets the keyboard focus. This can be
   --    used to transfer the focus to some specific part of the
   --    widget. Connecting to "grab_focus" should be done with the After
   --    parameter set to True.
   --
   --  - "float_child"
   --    procedure Handler (Child : access MDI_Child_Record'Class);

   --    Emitted when a child is set as floating
   --
   --  - "unfloat_child"
   --    procedure Handler (Child : access MDI_Child_Record'Class);
   --
   --    Emitted when a child is put back in the main MDI window
   --
   --  - "child_state_changed"
   --    procedure Handler (Child : access MDI_Child_Record'Class);
   --
   --    Emitted when the state of the child has changed. See the function
   --    Get_State. In particular, this signal can be detected when a child is
   --    removed from the current perspective (the new state is "invisible"),
