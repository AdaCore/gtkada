--  Gtk.Builder - Build an interface from an XML UI definition
--
--  A Gtk_Builder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions of a
--  user interface and instantiates the described objects. To pass a
--  description to a Gtk_Builder, call Add_From_File or Add_From_String.
--  These subprograms can be called multiple times; the builder merges the
--  content of all descriptions.
--
--  A Gtk_Builder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed and
--  drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can cause
--  the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not contained
--  in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a builder, it is
--  the responsibility of the user to call Gtk.Widget.Destroy to get rid of
--  them and all the widgets they contain.
--
--  The subprogram Get_Object can be used to access the widgets in the
--  interface by the names assigned to them inside the UI description.
--  Toplevel windows returned by this subprogram will stay around until the
--  user explicitly destroys them with Gtk.Widget.Destroy.
--  Other widgets will either be part of a larger hierarchy constructed by
--  the builder (in which case you should not have to worry about their
--  lifecycle), or without a parent, in which case they have to be added
--  to some container to make use of them. Non-widget objects need to be
--  reffed with Glib.Object.Ref to keep them beyond the lifespan of the
--  builder.
--
--  The subprogram Connect_Signals_Full can be used to connect handlers to the
--  named signals in the description.
