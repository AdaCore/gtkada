--  <description>
--  A GtkWindow is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets. Windows
--  normally have decorations that are under the control of the windowing
--  system and allow the user to manipulate the window (resize it, move it,
--  close it,...).
--
--  GTK+ also allows windows to have a resize grip (a small area in the lower
--  right or left corner) which can be clicked to reszie the window. To control
--  whether a window has a resize grip, use Gtk.Window.Set_Has_Resize_Grip.
--
--  == GtkWindow as GtkBuildable ==
--
--  The GtkWindow implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
--  custom <tag class="starttag">accel-groups</tag> element, which supports any
--  number of <tag class="starttag">group</tag> elements representing the
--  Gtk.Accel_Group.Gtk_Accel_Group objects you want to add to your window
--  (synonymous with Gtk.Window.Add_Accel_Group.
--
--  == A UI definition fragment with accel groups ==
--
--    <object class="GtkWindow">
--    <accel-groups>
--    <group name="accelgroup1"/>
--    </accel-groups>
--    </object>

   --  normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to use the "natural"
   --  default size (the size request of the window).
   --  For more control over a window's initial size and how resizing works,
   --  investigate Gtk.Window.Set_Geometry_Hints.
   --  For some uses, Gtk.Window.Resize is a more appropriate function.
   --  Gtk.Window.Resize changes the current size of the window, rather than
   --  the size to be used on initial display. Gtk.Window.Resize always affects
   --  the window itself, not the geometry widget.
   --  The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is
   --  shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size it
   --  had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.
   --  Windows can't actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
   --  passing 0 for Width and Height is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.

   procedure Get_Position

   --  the returned value varies with window gravity. See Gtk.Window.Move for
   --  more details.
   --  If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
   --  GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that Gtk.Window.Get_Position gets the
   --  position of the top-left corner of the window manager frame for the
   --  window. Gtk.Window.Move sets the position of this same top-left corner.
   --  Gtk.Window.Get_Position is not 100% reliable because the X Window
   --  System does not specify a way to obtain the geometry of the decorations
   --  placed on a window by the window manager. Thus GTK+ is using a "best
   --  guess" that works with most window managers.
   --  Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with
   --  respect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window to its
   --  current position as returned by Gtk.Window.Get_Position tends to result
   --  in moving the window slightly. Window managers are slowly getting better
   --  over time.
   --  If a window has gravity GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager frame is
   --  not relevant, and thus Gtk.Window.Get_Position will always produce
   --  accurate results. However you can't use static gravity to do things like
   --  place a window in a corner of the screen, because static gravity ignores
   --  the window manager decorations.
   --  If you are saving and restoring your application's window positions,
   --  you should know that it's impossible for applications to do this without
   --  getting it somewhat wrong because applications do not have sufficient
   --  knowledge of window manager state. The Correct Mechanism is to support

   --  Obtains the current size of Window. If Window is not onscreen, it
   --  returns the size GTK+ will suggest to the <link
   --  linkend="gtk-X11-arch">window manager</link> for the initial window size
   --  (but this is not reliably the same as the size the window manager will
   --  actually select). The size obtained by Gtk.Window.Get_Size is the last
   --  size received in a Gdk.Event.Gdk_Event_Configure, that is, GTK+ uses its
   --  locally-stored size, rather than querying the X server for the size. As
   --  a result, if you call Gtk.Window.Resize then immediately call
   --  Gtk.Window.Get_Size, the size won't have taken effect yet. After the
   --  window manager processes the resize request, GTK+ receives notification
   --  that the size has changed via a configure event, and the size of the
   --  window gets updated.
   --  Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race condition,
   --  because the size of the window may change between the time that you get
   --  the size and the time that you perform some action assuming that size is
   --  the current size. To avoid race conditions, connect to "configure-event"
   --  on the window and adjust your size-dependent state to match the size
   --  delivered in the Gdk.Event.Gdk_Event_Configure.
   --  Note 2: The returned size does *not* include the size of the window
   --  manager decorations (aka the window frame or border). Those are not
   --  drawn by GTK+ and GTK+ has no reliable method of determining their size.
   --  Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to position the
   --  window onscreen, there may be a better way. The preferred way is to
   --  simply set the window's semantic type with Gtk.Window.Set_Type_Hint,
   --  which allows the window manager to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set
   --  the transient parent of dialogs with Gtk.Window.Set_Transient_For window
   --  managers will often center the dialog over its parent window. It's much
   --  preferred to let the window manager handle these things rather than
   --  doing it yourself, because all apps will behave consistently and
   --  according to user prefs if the window manager handles it. Also, the
   --  window manager can take the size of the window decorations/border into
   --  account, while your application cannot.
   --  In any case, if you insist on application-specified window positioning,
   --  there's *still* a better way than doing it yourself -
   --  Gtk.Window.Set_Position will frequently handle the details for you.
