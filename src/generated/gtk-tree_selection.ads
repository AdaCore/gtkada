--  <description>
--  The Gtk.Tree_Selection.Gtk_Tree_Selection object is a helper object to
--  manage the selection for a Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View widget. The
--  Gtk.Tree_Selection.Gtk_Tree_Selection object is automatically created when
--  a new Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View widget is created, and cannot exist
--  independentally of this widget. The primary reason the
--  Gtk.Tree_Selection.Gtk_Tree_Selection objects exists is for cleanliness of
--  code and API. That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions
--  could not be methods on the Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View widget instead of a
--  separate function.
--
--  The Gtk.Tree_Selection.Gtk_Tree_Selection object is gotten from a
--  Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View by calling Gtk.Tree_View.Get_Selection. It can
--  be manipulated to check the selection status of the tree, as well as select
--  and deselect individual rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a
--  result, multiple views of the same model can have completely different
--  selections. Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the
--  model that is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its
--  parents first.
--
--  One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of a
--  view is that the Gtk.Tree_Selection.Gtk_Tree_Selection::changed signal is
--  mostly a hint. That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is
--  selected. Additionally, it may on occasion emit a
--  Gtk.Tree_Selection.Gtk_Tree_Selection::changed signal when nothing has
--  happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling select_row on an
--  already selected row).
