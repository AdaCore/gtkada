--  <description>
--  A Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter is a tree model which wraps
--  another tree model, and can do the following things:
--
--     * Filter specific rows, based on data from a "visible column", a column
--  storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not, or
--  based on the return value of a "visible function", which gets a model, iter
--  and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the row should be
--  filtered or not.
--
--     * Modify the "appearance" of the model, using a modify function. This
--  is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some values and also for
--  creating a completely different model based on the given child model.
--
--     * Set a different root node, also known as a "virtual root". You can
--  pass in a Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Path indicating the root node for the
--  filter at construction time.
--
--  The basic API is similar to Gtk.Tree_Model_Sort.Gtk_Tree_Model_Sort. For
--  an example on its usage, see the section on
--  Gtk.Tree_Model_Sort.Gtk_Tree_Model_Sort.
--
--  When using Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter, it is important to
--  realize that Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter maintains an
--  internal cache of all nodes which are visible in its clients. The cache is
--  likely to be a subtree of the tree exposed by the child model.
--  Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter will not cache the entire child
--  model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism that is
--  exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model implements
--  reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted because of
--  reference counting rule 3, see the Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Model
--  documentation. (Note that e.g. Gtk.Tree_Store.Gtk_Tree_Store does not
--  implement reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
--  the receiving node is not visible).
--
--  Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply. In
--  general, visible functions should only use data or properties from the node
--  for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings or its
--  parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child node is not
--  possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly. When no such
--  reference exists, no signals may be received for these child nodes (see
--  reference couting rule number 3 in the Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Model
--  section).
--
--  Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state of its
--  child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
--  Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter explicitly supports this. For
--  example, when a node does not have any children, you might not want the
--  node to be visible. As soon as the first row is added to the node's child
--  level (or the last row removed), the node's visibility should be updated.
--
--  This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order to
--  accommodate this, Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter must make
--  sure the necesary signals are received from the child model. This is
--  achieved by building, for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to
--  Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter's clients, the child level (if
--  any) and take a reference on the first node in this level. Furthermore, for
--  every row-inserted, row-changed or row-deleted signal (also these which
--  were not handled because the node was not cached),
--  Gtk.Tree_Model_Filter.Gtk_Tree_Model_Filter will check if the visibility
--  state of any parent node has changed.
--
--  Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two cases.
--  For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes in a
--  child's child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your own. In
--  this case, either rely on Gtk.Tree_Store.Gtk_Tree_Store to emit all signals
--  because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that do
--  implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
--  yourself.
