--  <description>
--  The Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Model interface defines a generic tree
--  interface for use by the Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View widget. It is an
--  abstract interface, and is designed to be usable with any appropriate data
--  structure. The programmer just has to implement this interface on their own
--  data type for it to be viewable by a Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View widget.
--
--  The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
--  columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where every
--  node has different values depending on which column is being queried. The
--  type of data found in a column is determined by using the GType system (ie.
--  G_TYPE_INT, GTK_TYPE_BUTTON, G_TYPE_POINTER, etc). The types are
--  homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is important to note that this
--  interface only provides a way of examining a model and observing changes.
--  The implementation of each individual model decides how and if changes are
--  made.
--
--  In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to write
--  their own specialized model, two generic models are provided &mdash; the
--  Gtk.Tree_Store.Gtk_Tree_Store and the Gtk.List_Store.Gtk_List_Store. To use
--  these, the developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary.
--  These models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
--  interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and storing
--  data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists, these two models
--  are sufficient.
--
--  Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can query
--  for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain column on that
--  node. There are two structures used to reference a particular node in a
--  model. They are the Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Path and the
--  Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Iter[
--
--  Here, <abbrev>iter</abbrev> is short for <quote>iterator</quote>]. Most of
--  the interface consists of operations on a Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Iter.
--
--  A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model that
--  may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific model. The
--  Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Path struct can be converted into either an array
--  of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list of numbers
--  separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset at that level. Thus,
--  the path <quote>0</quote> refers to the root node and the path
--  <quote>2:4</quote> refers to the fifth child of the third node.
--
--  By contrast, a Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Iter is a reference to a specific
--  node on a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
--  generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific way.
--  One can convert a path to an iterator by calling Gtk.Tree_Model.Get_Iter.
--  These iterators are the primary way of accessing a model and are similar to
--  the iterators used by Gtk.Text_Buffer.Gtk_Text_Buffer. They are generally
--  statically allocated on the stack and only used for a short time. The model
--  interface defines a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
--
--  It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data. For
--  example, the Gtk.List_Store.Gtk_List_Store model, which is internally a
--  simple linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
--  Gtk.Tree_Model_Sort.Gtk_Tree_Model_Sort stores an array and an offset in
--  two of the pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
--  generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for catching
--  errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
--
--  The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first. Iterators
--  are expected to always be valid for as long as the model is unchanged (and
--  doesn't emit a signal). The model is considered to own all outstanding
--  iterators and nothing needs to be done to free them from the user's point
--  of view. Additionally, some models guarantee that an iterator is valid for
--  as long as the node it refers to is valid (most notably the
--  Gtk.Tree_Store.Gtk_Tree_Store and Gtk.List_Store.Gtk_List_Store). Although
--  generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for the case where
--  iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very important performance
--  enhancements were made in the sort model. As a result, the
--  GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to indicate this behavior.
--
--  To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are provided.
--  The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at the location
--  <quote>3:2:5</quote>. While the first method shown is easier, the second is
--  much more common, as you often get paths from callbacks.
--
--  == Acquiring a <structname>GtkTreeIter</structname> ==
--
--    /* Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location */
--    GtkTreePath *path;
--    GtkTreeIter iter;
--    GtkTreeIter parent_iter;
--    /* get the iterator from a string */
--    gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model, &amp;iter, "3:2:5");
--    /* get the iterator from a path */
--    path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
--    gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &amp;iter, path);
--    gtk_tree_path_free (path);
--    /* walk the tree to find the iterator */
--    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &amp;iter, NULL, 3);
--    parent_iter = iter;
--    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &amp;iter, &amp;parent_iter, 2);
--    parent_iter = iter;
--    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &amp;iter, &amp;parent_iter, 5);
--
--  This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list and
--  getting a string and an integer from each row. The
--  <function>populate_model</function> function used below is not shown, as it
--  is specific to the Gtk.List_Store.Gtk_List_Store. For information on how to
--  write such a function, see the Gtk.List_Store.Gtk_List_Store documentation.
--
--  == Reading data from a <structname>GtkTreeModel</structname> ==
--
--    enum
--    {
--       STRING_COLUMN,
--       INT_COLUMN,
--       N_COLUMNS
--    };
--    ...
--    GtkTreeModel *list_store;
--    GtkTreeIter iter;
--    gboolean valid;
--    gint row_count = 0;
--    /* make a new list_store */
--    list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS, G_TYPE_STRING, G_TYPE_INT);
--    /* Fill the list store with data */
--    populate_model (list_store);
--    /* Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
--    * through the list, reading each row. */
--    for (valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store, &amp;iter);
--       valid;
--       valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store, &amp;iter))
--    {
--       gchar *str_data;
--       gint   int_data;
--       /* Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get
--       * with a '-1' value
--       */
--       gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &amp;iter,
--          STRING_COLUMN, &amp;str_data,
--          INT_COLUMN, &amp;int_data,
--          -1);
--       /* Do something with the data */
--       g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n", row_count, str_data, int_data);
--       g_free (str_data);
--       row_count++;
--    }
--
--  The Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Model interface contains two methods for
--  reference counting: Gtk.Tree_Model.Ref_Node and Gtk.Tree_Model.Unref_Node.
--  These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting is
--  meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being displayed.
--  Gtk.Tree_View.Gtk_Tree_View will take a reference on a node when it is
--  visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded. Being
--  displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly visible to the
--  user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting scheme a caching
--  model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache a node based on the
--  reference count. A file-system based model would not want to keep the
--  entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the folders that are currently
--  expanded in every current view.
--
--  When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
--  into account:
--
--     * Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its
--  parent. This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be
--  referenced as well.
--
--     * Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is
--  not possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
--  row-deleted signal is received.
--
--     * Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of
--  its siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
--  required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
--  however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level is
--  always referenced when any view is attached).
