--  <description>
--  This widget provides an empty canvas on which the application can draw
--  anything.
-- 
--  Note that this widget is simply an empty space, and that you need to
--  connect it to events to make it useful. For instance, you might want to do
--  one of the following :
-- 
--  * Connect it to "expose_event": The handlers are called every time the
--  widget needs to be redrawn. You can then draw anything you want on the
--  canvas, after getting its associated window with a call to
--  Gtk.Widget.Get_Window. Note that the event mask is automatically set up to
--  accept expose_events.
-- 
--  * Connect it to "button_press_event" and "button_release_event" events,
--  when you want it to react to user input. Note that you need to set up the
--  event mask with a call to Gtk.Widget.Set_Events.
-- 
--  See also the Double_Buffer widget provided in the GtkAda examples for an
--  advanced example that demonstrates how to use double buffering, to avoid
--  flickering in your drawings.
