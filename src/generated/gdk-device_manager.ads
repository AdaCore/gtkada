--  <description>
--  In addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user interface input, GDK
--  contains support for a variety of input devices, including graphics
--  tablets, touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards interacting
--  simultaneously with the user interface. Such input devices often have
--  additional features, such as sub-pixel positioning information and
--  additional device-dependent information.
--
--  In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the
--  device hierarchy (such as virtual devices being created or removed, or
--  physical devices being plugged or unplugged), GDK provides
--  Gdk.Device_Manager.Gdk_Device_Manager.
--
--  By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
--  keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be changed
--  by calling gdk_disable_multidevice before Gdk.Display.Open. There should
--  rarely be a need to do that though, since GDK defaults to a compatibility
--  mode in which it will emit just one enter/leave event pair for all devices
--  on a window. To enable per-device enter/leave events and other
--  multi-pointer interaction features, Gdk.Window.Set_Support_Multidevice must
--  be called on Gdk_Windows (or Gtk.Widget.Set_Support_Multidevice on
--  widgets). window. See the Gdk.Window.Set_Support_Multidevice documentation
--  for more information.
--
--  On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2. Unless
--  gdk_disable_multidevice is called, the XInput 2
--  Gdk.Device_Manager.Gdk_Device_Manager implementation will be used as the
--  input source. Otherwise either the core or XInput 1 implementations will be
--  used.
--
--  For simple applications that don't have any special interest in input
--  devices, the so-called 'client pointer' provides a reasonable approximation
--  to a simple setup with a single pointer and keyboard. The device that has
--  been set as the client pointer can be accessed via
--  Gdk.Device_Manager.Get_Client_Pointer.
--
--  Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual
--  devices (or master devices) are represented by the pointer cursors and
--  keyboard foci that are seen on the screen. Physical devices (or slave
--  devices) represent the hardware that is controlling the virtual devices,
--  and thus have no visible cursor on the screen.
--
--  Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
--  pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through
--  Gdk.Device.Get_Associated_Device.
--
--  There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could
--  be controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also be
--  "floating", which means they are not attached to any virtual device.
--

--
--  By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all
--  master devices, setting the Gdk.Device.Gdk_Device for all events coming
--  from input devices. Events containing device information are
--  GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2_BUTTON_PRESS,
--  GDK_3_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_SCROLL, GDK_KEY_PRESS,
--  GDK_KEY_RELEASE, GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY, GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY, GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE,
--  GDK_PROXIMITY_IN, GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT, GDK_DRAG_ENTER, GDK_DRAG_LEAVE,
--  GDK_DRAG_MOTION, GDK_DRAG_STATUS, GDK_DROP_START, GDK_DROP_FINISHED and
--  GDK_GRAB_BROKEN. When dealing with an event on a master device, it is
--  possible to get the source (slave) device that the event originated from
--  via gdk_event_get_source_device.
--
--  In order to listen for events coming from devices other than a virtual
--  device, Gdk.Window.Set_Device_Events must be called. Generally, this
--  function can be used to modify the event mask for any given device.
--
--  Input devices may also provide additional information besides X/Y. For
--  example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and X/Y tilt
--  information. This information is device-dependent, and may be queried
--  through gdk_device_get_axis. In multidevice mode, virtual devices will
--  change axes in order to always represent the physical device that is
--  routing events through it. Whenever the physical device changes, the
--  Gdk.Device.Gdk_Device:n-axes property will be notified, and
--  gdk_device_list_axes will return the new device axes.
--
--  Devices may also have associated 'keys' or macro buttons. Such keys can be
--  globally set to map into normal X keyboard events. The mapping is set using
--  Gdk.Device.Set_Key.
