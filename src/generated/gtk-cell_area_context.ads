--  <description>
--  The Gtk.Cell_Area_Context.Gtk_Cell_Area_Context object is created by a
--  given Gtk.Cell_Area.Gtk_Cell_Area implementation via its
--  Gtk.Cell_Area_Class.Gtk_Cell_Area_Class.create_context virtual method and
--  is used to store cell sizes and alignments for a series of
--  Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Model rows that are requested and rendered in the
--  same context.
--
--  Gtk.Cell_Layout.Gtk_Cell_Layout widgets can create any number of contexts
--  in which to request and render groups of data rows. However, it's important
--  that the same context which was used to request sizes for a given
--  Gtk.Tree_Model.Gtk_Tree_Model row also be used for the same row when
--  calling other Gtk.Cell_Area.Gtk_Cell_Area APIs such as Gtk.Cell_Area.Render
--  and Gtk.Cell_Area.Event.

   --  with Gtk.Cell_Area.Get_Preferred_Width.
   --  When the new overall size of the context requires that the allocated
   --  size changes (or whenever this allocation changes at all), the variable
   --  row sizes need to be re-requested for every row.
   --  For instance, if the rows are displayed all with the same width from
   --  top to bottom then a change in the allocated width necessitates a
   --  recalculation of all the displayed row heights using
   --  Gtk.Cell_Area.Get_Preferred_Height_For_Width.
