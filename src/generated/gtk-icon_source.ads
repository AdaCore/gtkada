--  An icon source contains a Gdk_Pixbuf (or image filename) that serves as
--  the base image for one or more of the icons in an icon set, along with a
--  specification for which icons in the icon set will be based on that pixbuf
--  or image file. An icon set contains a set of icons that represent "the
--  same" logical concept in different states, different global text
--  directions, and different sizes.
--
--  So for example a web browser's "Back to Previous Page" icon might point in
--  a different direction in Hebrew and in English; it might look different
--  when insensitive; and it might change size depending on toolbar mode
--  (small/large icons). So a single icon set would contain all those variants
--  of the icon. An icon set contains a list of icon sources from which it can
--  derive specific icon variants in the set.
--
--  In the simplest case, an icon set contains one source pixbuf from which it
--  derives all variants.
--
--  If you want to use a different base pixbuf for different icon variants,
--  you create multiple icon sources, mark which variants they'll be used to
--  create, and add them to the icon set with Add_Source (see below).
--
--  By default, the icon source has all parameters wildcarded. That is, the
--  icon source will be used as the base icon for any desired text direction,
--  widget state, or icon size.
