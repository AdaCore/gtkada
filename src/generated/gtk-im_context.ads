--  <description>
--  Gtk.IM_Context.Gtk_IM_Context defines the interface for GTK+ input
--  methods. An input method is used by GTK+ text input widgets like
--  Gtk.GEntry.Gtk_Entry to map from key events to Unicode character strings.
--
--  The user may change the current input method via a context menu, unless
--  the Gtk.Settings.Gtk_Settings:gtk-show-input-method-menu GtkSettings
--  property is set to FALSE. The default input method can be set
--  programmatically via the Gtk.Settings.Gtk_Settings:gtk-im-module
--  GtkSettings property. Alternatively, you may set the GTK_IM_MODULE
--  environment variable as documented in gtk-running.
--
--  The Gtk.GEntry.Gtk_Entry Gtk.GEntry.Gtk_Entry:im-module and
--  Gtk.Text_View.Gtk_Text_View Gtk.Text_View.Gtk_Text_View:im-module
--  properties may also be used to set input methods for specific widget
--  instances. For instance, a certain entry widget might be expected to
--  contain certain characters which would be easier to input with a certain
--  input method.
--
--  An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence and finally
--  output the composed result. This is called preediting, and an input method
--  may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
--  composition states as preedit text. For instance, the default GTK+ input
--  method implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding
--  down the Control and Shift keys and then typing "U" followed by the
--  hexadecimal digits of the code point. When releasing the Control and Shift
--  keys, preediting ends and the character is inserted as text.
--  Ctrl+Shift+u20AC for example results in the euro symbol.
--
--  Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK+ widgets as
--  loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
--  implements a subclass of Gtk.IM_Context.Gtk_IM_Context or
--  Gtk.IM_Context_Simple.Gtk_IM_Context_Simple and exports these four
--  functions:
--
--    void im_module_init(Gtype.Module.Gtype_Module *module);
--
--  This function should register the GType of the
--  Gtk.IM_Context.Gtk_IM_Context subclass which implements the input method by
--  means of g_type_module_register_type. Note that g_type_register_static
--  cannot be used as the type needs to be registered dynamically.
--
--    void im_module_exit(void);
--
--  Here goes any cleanup code your input method might require on module
--  unload.
--
--    void im_module_list(const Gtk_IMContext_Info ***contexts, int *n_contexts)
--    {
--       *contexts = info_list;
--       *n_contexts = G_N_ELEMENTS (info_list);
--    }
--
--  This function returns the list of input methods provided by the module.
--  The example implementation above shows a common solution and simply returns
--  a pointer to statically defined array of Gtk_IMContext_Info items for each
--  provided input method.
--
--    Gtk.IM_Context.Gtk_IM_Context * im_module_create(const Gchar *context_id);
--
--  This function should return a pointer to a newly created instance of the
--  Gtk.IM_Context.Gtk_IM_Context subclass identified by Context_Id. The
--  context ID is the same as specified in the Gtk_IMContext_Info array
--  returned by im_module_list.
--
--  After a new loadable input method module has been installed on the system,
--  the configuration file 'gtk.immodules' needs to be regenerated by <link
--  linkend="gtk-query-immodules-3.0">gtk-query-immodules-3.0</link>, in order
--  for the new input method to become available to GTK+ applications.

   -- Methods --
   -------------

   function Delete_Surrounding
      (Self    : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record;
       Offset  : Gint;
       N_Chars : Gint) return Boolean;
   --  Asks the widget that the input context is attached to to delete
   --  characters around the cursor position by emitting the
   --  GtkIMContext::delete_surrounding signal. Note that Offset and N_Chars
   --  are in characters not in bytes which differs from the usage other places
   --  in Gtk.IM_Context.Gtk_IM_Context.
   --  In order to use this function, you should first call
   --  gtk_im_context_get_surrounding to get the current context, and call this
   --  function immediately afterwards to make sure that you know what you are
   --  deleting. You should also account for the fact that even if the signal
   --  was handled, the input context might not have deleted all the characters
   --  that were requested to be deleted.
   --  This function is used by an input method that wants to make
   --  subsitutions in the existing text in response to new input. It is not
   --  useful for applications.
   --  "offset": offset from cursor position in chars; a negative value means
   --  start before the cursor.
   --  "n_chars": number of characters to delete.

   function Filter_Keypress
      (Self  : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record;
       Event : Gdk.Event.Gdk_Event_Key) return Boolean;
   --  Allow an input method to internally handle key press and release
   --  events. If this function returns True, then no further processing should
   --  be done for this key event.
   --  "event": the key event

   procedure Focus_In (Self : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record);
   --  Notify the input method that the widget to which this input context
   --  corresponds has gained focus. The input method may, for example, change
   --  the displayed feedback to reflect this change.

   procedure Focus_Out (Self : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record);
   --  Notify the input method that the widget to which this input context
   --  corresponds has lost focus. The input method may, for example, change
   --  the displayed feedback or reset the contexts state to reflect this
   --  change.

   procedure Reset (Self : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record);
   --  Notify the input method that a change such as a change in cursor
   --  position has been made. This will typically cause the input method to
   --  clear the preedit state.

   procedure Set_Client_Window
      (Self   : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record;
       Window : Gdk.Gdk_Window);
   --  Set the client window for the input context; this is the Gdk.Gdk_Window
   --  in which the input appears. This window is used in order to correctly
   --  position status windows, and may also be used for purposes internal to
   --  the input method.
   --  "window": the client window. This may be null to indicate that the
   --  previous client window no longer exists.

   procedure Set_Cursor_Location
      (Self : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record;
       Area : Gdk.Rectangle.Gdk_Rectangle);
   --  Notify the input method that a change in cursor position has been made.
   --  The location is relative to the client window.
   --  "area": new location

   procedure Set_Surrounding
      (Self         : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record;
       Text         : UTF8_String;
       Len          : Gint;
       Cursor_Index : Gint);
   --  Sets surrounding context around the insertion point and preedit string.
   --  This function is expected to be called in response to the
   --  GtkIMContext::retrieve_surrounding signal, and will likely have no
   --  effect if called at other times.
   --  "text": text surrounding the insertion point, as UTF-8. the preedit
   --  string should not be included within Text.
   --  "len": the length of Text, or -1 if Text is nul-terminated
   --  "cursor_index": the byte index of the insertion cursor within Text.

   procedure Set_Use_Preedit
      (Self        : not null access Gtk_IM_Context_Record;
       Use_Preedit : Boolean);
   --  Sets whether the IM context should use the preedit string to display
   --  feedback. If Use_Preedit is FALSE (default is TRUE), then the IM context
   --  may use some other method to display feedback, such as displaying it in
   --  a child of the root window.
   --  "use_preedit": whether the IM context should use the preedit string.
