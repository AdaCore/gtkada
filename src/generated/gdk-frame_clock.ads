--  <description>
--  A Gdk.Frame_Clock.Gdk_Frame_Clock tells the application when to update and
--  repaint a window. This may be synced to the vertical refresh rate of the
--  monitor, for example. Even when the frame clock uses a simple timer rather
--  than a hardware-based vertical sync, the frame clock helps because it
--  ensures everything paints at the same time (reducing the total number of
--  frames). The frame clock can also automatically stop painting when it knows
--  the frames will not be visible, or scale back animation framerates.
--
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Gdk_Frame_Clock is designed to be compatible with an
--  OpenGL-based implementation or with mozRequestAnimationFrame in Firefox,
--  for example.
--
--  A frame clock is idle until someone requests a frame with
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Request_Phase. At some later point that makes sense for the
--  synchronization being implemented, the clock will process a frame and emit
--  signals for each phase that has been requested. (See the signals of the
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Gdk_Frame_Clock class for documentation of the phases.
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Gdk_Frame_Clock_Phase_Update and the
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Gdk_Frame_Clock::update signal are most interesting for
--  application writers, and are used to update the animations, using the frame
--  time given by Gdk.Frame_Clock.Get_Frame_Time.
--
--  The frame time is reported in microseconds and generally in the same
--  timescale as g_get_monotonic_time, however, it is not the same as
--  g_get_monotonic_time. The frame time does not advance during the time a
--  frame is being painted, and outside of a frame, an attempt is made so that
--  all calls to Gdk.Frame_Clock.Get_Frame_Time that are called at a "similar"
--  time get the same value. This means that if different animations are timed
--  by looking at the difference in time between an initial value from
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Get_Frame_Time and the value inside the
--  Gdk.Frame_Clock.Gdk_Frame_Clock::update signal of the clock, they will stay
--  exactly synchronized.

   --  frame time, or if that's too old, an updated time.

   --  "phase": the phase that is requested
