--  <description>
--  Accelerator maps are used to define runtime configurable accelerators.
--  Functions for manipulating them are are usually used by higher level
--  convenience mechanisms like Gtk.UI_Manager.Gtk_UI_Manager and are thus
--  considered "low-level". You'll want to use them if you're manually creating
--  menus that should have user-configurable accelerators.
--
--  Accelerator is uniquely defined by:
--
-- 
--
--     * accelerator path
--
--     * accelerator key
--
--     * accelerator modifiers
--
--  The accelerator path must consist of
--  "<WINDOWTYPE>/Category1/Category2/.../Action", where WINDOWTYPE should be a
--  unique application-specific identifier that corresponds to the kind of
--  window the accelerator is being used in, e.g. "Gimp-Image",
--  "Abiword-Document" or "Gnumeric-Settings". The "Category1/.../Action"
--  portion is most appropriately chosen by the action the accelerator
--  triggers, i.e. for accelerators on menu items, choose the item's menu path,
--  e.g. "File/Save As", "Image/View/Zoom" or "Edit/Select All". So a full
--  valid accelerator path may look like: "<Gimp-Toolbox>/File/Dialogs/Tool
--  Options...".
--
--  All accelerators are stored inside one global Gtk.Accel_Map.Gtk_Accel_Map
--  that can be obtained using Gtk.Accel_Map.Get. See <link
--  linkend="monitoring-changes">Monitoring changes</link> for additional
--  details.
--
--  == Manipulating accelerators ==
--
--  New accelerators can be added using Gtk.Accel_Map.Add_Entry. To search for
--  specific accelerator, use Gtk.Accel_Map.Lookup_Entry. Modifications of
--  existing accelerators should be done using Gtk.Accel_Map.Change_Entry.
--
--  In order to avoid having some accelerators changed, they can be locked
--  using Gtk.Accel_Map.Lock_Path. Unlocking is done using
--  Gtk.Accel_Map.Unlock_Path.
--
--  == Saving and loading accelerator maps ==
--
--  Accelerator maps can be saved to and loaded from some external resource.
--  For simple saving and loading from file, Gtk.Accel_Map.Save and
--  Gtk.Accel_Map.Load are provided. Saving and loading can also be done by
--  providing file descriptor to Gtk.Accel_Map.Save_Fd and
--  Gtk.Accel_Map.Load_Fd.
--
--  == Monitoring changes ==
--
--  Gtk.Accel_Map.Gtk_Accel_Map object is only useful for monitoring changes
--  of accelerators. By connecting to Gtk.Accel_Map.Gtk_Accel_Map::changed
--  signal, one can monitor changes of all accelerators. It is also possible to
--  monitor only single accelerator path by using it as a detail of the
--  Gtk.Accel_Map.Gtk_Accel_Map::changed signal.
