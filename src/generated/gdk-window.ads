   --  The Gdk.Window.Gdk_Geometry struct gives the window manager information

   --  the GTK+ level using Gtk.Window.Set_Geometry_Hints.
   --  Gtk.Window.Gtk_Window then sets the hints on the Gdk.Gdk_Window it
   --  creates.
   --
   --  Gdk.Window.Set_Geometry_Hints expects the hints to be fully valid
   --  already and simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast,
   --  Gtk.Window.Set_Geometry_Hints performs some interpretation. For example,
   --  Gtk.Window.Gtk_Window will apply the hints to the geometry widget
   --  instead of the toplevel window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the
   --  Min_Width/Min_Height/Max_Width/Max_Height fields may be set to -1, and
   --  Gtk.Window.Gtk_Window will substitute the size request of the window or
   --  geometry widget. If the minimum size hint is not provided,
   --  Gtk.Window.Gtk_Window will use its requisition as the minimum size. If
   --  the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is set,
   --  Gtk.Window.Gtk_Window will take the minimum size as the minimum size of
   --  the geometry widget rather than the entire window. The base size is
   --  treated similarly.
   --
   --  The canonical use-case for Gtk.Window.Set_Geometry_Hints is to get a
   --  terminal widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should
   --  be the geometry widget; Gtk.Window.Gtk_Window will then automatically
   --  set the base size to the size of other widgets in the terminal window,
   --  such as the menubar and scrollbar. Then, the Width_Inc and Height_Inc
   --  fields should be set to the size of one character in the terminal.
   --  Finally, the base size should be set to the size of one character. The
   --  net effect is that the minimum size of the terminal will have a 1x1
   --  character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on the "character grid"
   --  will be allowed.
   --
   --  Here's an example of how the terminal example would be implemented,
   --  assuming a terminal area widget called "terminal" and a toplevel window
   --  "toplevel":
   --
   --    GdkGeometry hints;
   --    hints.base_width = terminal->char_width;
   --    hints.base_height = terminal->char_height;
   --    hints.min_width = terminal->char_width;
   --    hints.min_height = terminal->char_height;
   --    hints.width_inc = terminal->char_width;
   --    hints.height_inc = terminal->char_height;
   --    gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (GTK_WINDOW (toplevel),
   --       GTK_WIDGET (terminal),
   --       &hints,
   --       GDK_HINT_RESIZE_INC |
   --       GDK_HINT_MIN_SIZE |
   --       GDK_HINT_BASE_SIZE);
   --
   --  The other useful fields are the Min_Aspect and Max_Aspect fields; these
   --  contain a width/height ratio as a floating point number. If a geometry
   --  widget is set, the aspect applies to the geometry widget rather than the
   --  entire window. The most common use of these hints is probably to set
   --  Min_Aspect and Max_Aspect to the same value, thus forcing the window to
   --  keep a constant aspect ratio.

   procedure Set_Debug_Updates (Setting : Boolean);
   --  With update debugging enabled, calls to Gdk.Window.Invalidate_Region
   --  clear the invalidated region of the screen to a noticeable color, and
   --  GDK pauses for a short time before sending exposes to windows during
   --  Gdk.Window.Process_Updates. The net effect is that you can see the
   --  invalid region for each window and watch redraws as they occur. This
   --  allows you to diagnose inefficiencies in your application.
   --  In essence, because the GDK rendering model prevents all flicker, if
   --  you are redrawing the same region 400 times you may never notice, aside
   --  from noticing a speed problem. Enabling update debugging causes GTK to
   --  flicker slowly and noticeably, so you can see exactly what's being
   --  redrawn when, in what order.
   --  The --gtk-debug=updates command line option passed to GTK+ programs
   --  enables this debug option at application startup time. That's usually
   --  more useful than calling Gdk.Window.Set_Debug_Updates yourself, though
   --  you might want to use this function to enable updates sometime after
   --  application startup time.

   --  emission, and its surface will be used.
   --
   --  Note that it is not possible to access the window's previous surface
   --  from within any callback of this signal. Calling
   --  gdk_offscreen_window_get_surface will lead to a crash.
