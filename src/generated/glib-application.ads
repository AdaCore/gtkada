--  <description>
--  A Glib.Application.Gapplication is the foundation of an application. It
--  wraps some low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as
--  the foundation for higher-level application classes such as
--  Gtk.Application.Gtk_Application or Mx_Application. In general, you should
--  not use this class outside of a higher level framework.
--
--  GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining a
--  "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can be
--  changed using Glib.Application.Hold and Glib.Application.Release. If it
--  drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
--  Gtk.Application.Gtk_Application employ the use count to ensure that the
--  application stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
--
--  Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
--  uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by providing a
--  unique application ID. If given, only one application with this ID can be
--  running at a time per session. The session concept is platform-dependent,
--  but corresponds roughly to a graphical desktop login. When your application
--  is launched again, its arguments are passed through platform communication
--  to the already running program. The already running instance of the program
--  is called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
--  always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus is used for
--  communication.
--
--  The use of Glib.Application.Gapplication differs from some other
--  commonly-used uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways.
--  The application is not expected to manually register itself and check if it
--  is the primary instance. Instead, the main function of a
--  Glib.Application.Gapplication should do very little more than instantiating
--  the application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then calling
--  Glib.Application.Run. All checks for uniqueness are done internally. If the
--  application is the primary instance then the startup signal is emitted and
--  the mainloop runs. If the application is not the primary instance then a
--  signal is sent to the primary instance and Glib.Application.Run promptly
--  returns. See the code examples below.
--
--  If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the same as
--  that of of a [D-Bus well-known bus
--  name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.htmlmessage-protocol-names-bus).
--  Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`,
--  `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`, `org._7_zip.Archiver`. For details
--  on valid application identifiers, see Glib.Application.Id_Is_Valid.
--
--  On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
--  on the user's session bus. This means that the uniqueness of your
--  application is scoped to the current session. It also means that your
--  application may provide additional services (through registration of other
--  object paths) at that bus name. The registration of these object paths
--  should be done with the shared GDBus session bus. Note that due to the
--  internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
--  (even if a main loop is not running). For this reason, you must ensure that
--  any object paths that you wish to register are registered before
--  Glib.Application.Gapplication attempts to acquire the bus name of your
--  application (which happens in g_application_register). Unfortunately, this
--  means that you cannot use Glib.Application.Get_Is_Remote to decide if you
--  want to register object paths.
--
--  GApplication also implements the Glib.Action_Group.Gaction_Group and
--  Glib.Action_Map.Gaction_Map interfaces and lets you easily export actions
--  by adding them with Glib.Action_Map.Add_Action. When invoking an action by
--  calling Glib.Action_Group.Activate_Action on the application, it is always
--  invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on the
--  session bus, and GIO provides the Gdbus.Action_Group.Gdbus_Action_Group
--  wrapper to conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a
--  Gdbus.Menu_Model.Gdbus_Menu_Model wrapper for remote access to exported
--  GMenu_Models.
--
--  There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
--
--  - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
--
--  - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
--
--  - by handling a command-line
--
--  - via activating an action
--
--  The Glib.Application.Gapplication::startup signal lets you handle the
--  application initialization for all of these in a single place.
--
--  Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
--  application, GApplication passes some â€˜platform data' from the launching
--  instance to the primary instance, in the form of a Glib.Variant.Gvariant
--  dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform data, override the
--  Before_Emit or After_Emit virtual functions in your
--  Glib.Application.Gapplication subclass. When dealing with
--  Glib.Application.Gapplication_Command_Line objects, the platform data is
--  directly available via Glib.Application.Get_Cwd,
--  Glib.Application.Get_Environ and Glib.Application.Get_Platform_Data.
--
--  As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
--  operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key "cwd"),
--  and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment variables and
--  their values) of the calling process (key "environ"). The environment is
--  only added to the platform data if the
--  Glib.Application.G_Application_Send_Environment flag is set.
--  Glib.Application.Gapplication subclasses can add their own platform data by
--  overriding the Add_Platform_Data virtual function. For instance,
--  Gtk.Application.Gtk_Application adds startup notification data in this way.
--
--  To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
--  Glib.Application.Gapplication::command-line signal or override the
--  local_command_line vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or
--  the local instance, respectively.
--
--  For an example of opening files with a GApplication, see
--  [gapplication-example-open.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-open.c).
--
--  For an example of using actions with GApplication, see
--  [gapplication-example-actions.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-actions.c).
--
--  For an example of using extra D-Bus hooks with GApplication, see
--  [gapplication-example-dbushooks.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-dbushooks.c).

   procedure Set_Resource_Base_Path
      (Self          : not null access Gapplication_Record;
       Resource_Path : UTF8_String := "");
   --  Sets (or unsets) the base resource path of Application.
   --  The path is used to automatically load various [application
   --  resources][gresource] such as menu layouts and action descriptions. The
   --  various types of resources will be found at fixed names relative to the
   --  given base path.
   --  By default, the resource base path is determined from the application
   --  ID by prefixing '/' and replacing each '.' with '/'. This is done at the
   --  time that the Glib.Application.Gapplication object is constructed.
   --  Changes to the application ID after that point will not have an impact
   --  on the resource base path.
   --  As an example, if the application has an ID of "org.example.app" then
   --  the default resource base path will be "/org/example/app". If this is a
   --  Gtk.Application.Gtk_Application (and you have not manually changed the
   --  path) then Gtk will then search for the menus of the application at
   --  "/org/example/app/gtk/menus.ui".
   --  See Gresource.Gresource for more information about adding resources to
   --  your application.
   --  You can disable automatic resource loading functionality by setting the
   --  path to null.
   --  Changing the resource base path once the application is running is not
   --  recommended. The point at which the resource path is consulted for
   --  forming paths for various purposes is unspecified. When writing a
   --  sub-class of Glib.Application.Gapplication you should either set the
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication:resource-base-path property at
   --  construction time, or call this function during the instance
   --  initialization. Alternatively, you can call this function in the
   --  GApplication_Class.startup virtual function, before chaining up to the
   --  parent implementation.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.42
   --  "resource_path": the resource path to use

   procedure Hold (Self : not null access Gapplication_Record);
   --  Increases the use count of Application.
   --  Use this function to indicate that the application has a reason to
   --  continue to run. For example, Glib.Application.Hold is called by GTK+
   --  when a toplevel window is on the screen.
   --  To cancel the hold, call Glib.Application.Release.

   procedure Mark_Busy (Self : not null access Gapplication_Record);
   --  Increases the busy count of Application.
   --  Use this function to indicate that the application is busy, for
   --  instance while a long running operation is pending.
   --  The busy state will be exposed to other processes, so a session shell
   --  will use that information to indicate the state to the user (e.g. with a
   --  spinner).
   --  To cancel the busy indication, use Glib.Application.Unmark_Busy.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.38

   procedure Quit (Self : not null access Gapplication_Record);
   --  Immediately quits the application.
   --  Upon return to the mainloop, Glib.Application.Run will return, calling
   --  only the 'shutdown' function before doing so.
   --  The hold count is ignored. Take care if your code has called
   --  Glib.Application.Hold on the application and is therefore still
   --  expecting it to exist. (Note that you may have called
   --  Glib.Application.Hold indirectly, for example through
   --  Gtk.Application.Add_Window.)
   --  The result of calling Glib.Application.Run again after it returns is
   --  unspecified.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.32

   procedure Release (Self : not null access Gapplication_Record);
   --  Decrease the use count of Application.
   --  When the use count reaches zero, the application will stop running.
   --  Never call this function except to cancel the effect of a previous call
   --  to Glib.Application.Hold.

   function Run
      (Self : not null access Gapplication_Record;
       Argc : Glib.Gint;
       Argv : GNAT.Strings.String_List) return Glib.Gint;
   --  Runs the application.
   --  This function is intended to be run from main and its return value is
   --  intended to be returned by main. Although you are expected to pass the
   --  Argc, Argv parameters from main to this function, it is possible to pass
   --  null if Argv is not available or commandline handling is not required.
   --  Note that on Windows, Argc and Argv are ignored, and
   --  g_win32_get_command_line is called internally (for proper support of
   --  Unicode commandline arguments).
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication will attempt to parse the commandline
   --  arguments. You can add commandline flags to the list of recognised
   --  options by way of g_application_add_main_option_entries. After this, the
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication::handle-local-options signal is emitted,
   --  from which the application can inspect the values of its GOption_Entrys.
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication::handle-local-options is a good place to
   --  handle options such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the
   --  local process is desired (instead of communicating with an
   --  already-running instance). A
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication::handle-local-options handler can stop
   --  further processing by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes
   --  the exit status of the process.
   --  What happens next depends on the flags: if
   --  Glib.Application.G_Application_Handles_Command_Line was specified then
   --  the remaining commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance,
   --  where a Glib.Application.Gapplication::command-line signal is emitted.
   --  Otherwise, the remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list
   --  of files. If there are no files listed, the application is activated via
   --  the Glib.Application.Gapplication::activate signal. If there are one or
   --  more files, and Glib.Application.G_Application_Handles_Open was
   --  specified then the files are opened via the
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication::open signal.
   --  If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
   --  commandline then you should implement your own
   --  Glib.Application.Gapplication subclass and override local_command_line.
   --  In this case, you most likely want to return True from your
   --  local_command_line implementation to suppress the default handling. See
   --  [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][gapplication-example-cmdline2] for an
   --  example.
   --  If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
   --  then the exit status is returned immediately. If the use count is
   --  non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
   --  falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
   --  If the Glib.Application.G_Application_Is_Service flag is set, then the
   --  service will run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero
   --  while waiting for the message that caused the activation to arrive.
   --  After that, if the use count falls to zero the application will exit
   --  immediately, except in the case that
   --  Glib.Application.Set_Inactivity_Timeout is in use.
   --  This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname), if not already set, to
   --  the basename of argv[0].
   --  Much like g_main_loop_run, this function will acquire the main context

   --  check (from the default handler for local_command_line) if

   --  service mode. The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
   --  "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument. This approach

   --  Checks if Application_Id is a valid application identifier.
   --  A valid ID is required for calls to Glib.Application.G_New and

   --  Application identifiers follow the same format as [D-Bus well-known bus
   --  names](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.htmlmessage-protocol-names-bus).
   --  For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
   --  reproduced here:
   --  - Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated
   --  by a period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one
   --  character.
   --  - Each element must only contain the ASCII characters
   --  `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`, with `-` discouraged in new application
   --  identifiers. Each element must not begin with a digit.
   --  - Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period)
   --  character (and thus at least two elements).
   --  - Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.
   --  - Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.
   --  Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application
   --  identifiers, but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications
   --  and APIs that refer to D-Bus, such as [Flatpak application
   --  IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.htmlidentifiers),
   --  the [`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry
   --  Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.htmldbus),
   --  and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object
   --  path resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid
   --  situations that require special-case handling, it is recommended that
   --  new application identifiers consistently replace hyphens with
   --  underscores.
   --  Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with
   --  the reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in
   --  lower-case), and it is conventional for the rest of the application
   --  identifier to consist of words run together, with initial capital
   --  letters.
   --  As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
   --  hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if
   --  it contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an
   --  underscore. For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application
   --  identifier for an archiving application, it might be named
   --  `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
   --  "application_id": a potential application identifier
