--  <description>
--  A GtkBuilder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions of a
--  user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create a
--  GtkBuilder from a user interface description, call
--  Gtk.Builder.Gtk_New_From_File, Gtk.Builder.Gtk_New_From_Resource or
--  Gtk.Builder.Gtk_New_From_String.
--
--  In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface descriptions
--  from multiple sources to the same GtkBuilder you can call
--  Gtk.Builder.Gtk_New to get an empty builder and populate it by (multiple)
--  calls to Gtk.Builder.Add_From_File, Gtk.Builder.Add_From_Resource or
--  Gtk.Builder.Add_From_String.
--
--  A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed and
--  drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can cause
--  the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not contained in
--  a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a builder, it is the
--  responsibility of the user to call Gtk.Widget.Destroy to get rid of them
--  and all the widgets they contain.
--
--  The functions Gtk.Builder.Get_Object and Gtk.Builder.Get_Objects can be
--  used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned to them
--  inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these functions
--  will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them with
--  Gtk.Widget.Destroy. Other widgets will either be part of a larger hierarchy
--  constructed by the builder (in which case you should not have to worry
--  about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which case they have to be
--  added to some container to make use of them. Non-widget objects need to be
--  reffed with g_object_ref to keep them beyond the lifespan of the builder.
--
--  The function Gtk.Builder.Connect_Signals and variants thereof can be used
--  to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
--
--  # GtkBuilder UI Definitions # {BUILDER-UI}
--
--  GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
--  specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the RELAX NG
--  schema below. We refer to these descriptions as "GtkBuilder UI definitions"
--  or just "UI definitions" if the context is clear. Do not confuse GtkBuilder
--  UI Definitions with [GtkUIManager UI Definitions][XML-UI], which are more
--  limited in scope. It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for
--  files containing GtkBuilder UI definitions.
--
--  [RELAX NG Compact
--  Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)
--
--  The toplevel element is <interface>. It optionally takes a "domain"
--  attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings using
--  dgettext in the domain specified. This can also be done by calling
--  Gtk.Builder.Set_Translation_Domain on the builder. Objects are described by
--  <object> elements, which can contain <property> elements to set properties,
--  <signal> elements which connect signals to handlers, and <child> elements,
--  which describe child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but
--  also e.g. actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A
--  <child> element contains an <object> element which describes the child
--  object. The target toolkit version(s) are described by <requires> elements,
--  the "lib" attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently the
--  only supported value is "gtk+") and the "version" attribute specifies the
--  target version in the form "<major>.<minor>". The builder will error out if
--  the version requirements are not met.
--
--  Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an <object> element
--  is specified by the "class" attribute. If the type has not been loaded yet,
--  GTK+ tries to find the get_type function from the class name by applying
--  heuristics. This works in most cases, but if necessary, it is possible to
--  specify the name of the get_type function explictly with the "type-func"
--  attribute. As a special case, GtkBuilder allows to use an object that has
--  been constructed by a Gtk.UI_Manager.Gtk_UI_Manager in another part of the
--  UI definition by specifying the id of the Gtk.UI_Manager.Gtk_UI_Manager in
--  the "constructor" attribute and the name of the object in the "id"
--  attribute.
--
--  Objects may be given a name with the "id" attribute, which allows the
--  application to retrieve them from the builder with Gtk.Builder.Get_Object.
--  An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other parts
--  of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending with ___ (3
--  underscores) for its own purposes.
--
--  Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
--  <property> element: the "name" attribute specifies the name of the
--  property, and the content of the element specifies the value. If the
--  "translatable" attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses gettext (or
--  dgettext if the builder has a translation domain set) to find a translation
--  for the value. This happens before the value is parsed, so it can be used
--  for properties of any type, but it is probably most useful for string
--  properties. It is also possible to specify a context to disambiguate short
--  strings, and comments which may help the translators.
--
--  GtkBuilder can parse textual representations for the most common property
--  types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers, booleans
--  (strings like "TRUE", "t", "yes", "y", "1" are interpreted as True, strings
--  like "FALSE", "f", "no", "n", "0" are interpreted as False), enumerations
--  (can be specified by their name, nick or integer value), flags (can be
--  specified by their name, nick, integer value, optionally combined with "|",
--  e.g. "GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED") and colors (in a format understood by
--  Gdk.RGBA.Parse).
--
--  GVariants can be specified in the format understood by Glib.Variant.Parse,
--  and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.
--
--  Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to objects
--  declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
--  Gtk.Builder.Expose_Object. In general, GtkBuilder allows forward references
--  to objects â€” declared in the local xml; an object doesn't have to be
--  constructed before it can be referred to. The exception to this rule is
--  that an object has to be constructed before it can be used as the value of
--  a construct-only property.
--
--  It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's property
--  value using the attributes "bind-source" to specify the source object of
--  the binding, "bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
--  "bind-flags" to specify the binding flags. Internally builder implements
--  this using GBinding objects. For more information see
--  g_object_bind_property
--
--  Signal handlers are set up with the <signal> element. The "name" attribute
--  specifies the name of the signal, and the "handler" attribute specifies the
--  function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries to find the
--  handler using g_module_symbol, but this can be changed by passing a custom
--  Gtk_Builder_Connect_Func to Gtk.Builder.Connect_Signals_Full. The remaining
--  attributes, "after", "swapped" and "object", have the same meaning as the
--  corresponding parameters of the g_signal_connect_object or
--  g_signal_connect_data functions. A "last_modification_time" attribute is
--  also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the builder.
--
--  Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly been
--  constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set properties on
--  them or to add further children (e.g. the Vbox of a Gtk.Dialog.Gtk_Dialog).
--  This can be achieved by setting the "internal-child" property of the
--  <child> element to a true value. Note that GtkBuilder still requires an
--  <object> element for the internal child, even if it has already been
--  constructed.
--
--  A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added (e.g.
--  tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in a UI
--  definition by specifying the "type" attribute on a <child> The possible
--  values for the "type" attribute are described in the sections describing
--  the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.
--
--  # A GtkBuilder UI Definition
--
--  |[ <interface> <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1"> <child
--  internal-child="vbox"> <object class="GtkBox" id="vbox1"> <property
--  name="border-width">10</property> <child internal-child="action_area">
--  <object class="GtkButtonBox" id="hbuttonbox1"> <property
--  name="border-width">20</property> <child> <object class="GtkButton"
--  id="ok_button"> <property name="label">gtk-ok</property> <property
--  name="use-stock">TRUE</property> <signal name="clicked"
--  handler="ok_button_clicked"/> </object> </child> </object> </child>
--  </object> </child> </object> </interface> ]|
--
--  Beyond this general structure, several object classes define their own XML
--  DTD fragments for filling in the ANY placeholders in the DTD above. Note
--  that a custom element in a <child> element gets parsed by the custom tag
--  handler of the parent object, while a custom element in an <object> element
--  gets parsed by the custom tag handler of the object.
--
--  These XML fragments are explained in the documentation of the respective
--  objects.
--
--  Additionally, since 3.10 a special <template> tag has been added to the
--  format allowing one to define a widget class's components. See the
--  [GtkWidget documentation][composite-templates] for details.
