       Above_Child : Boolean);
   --  Set whether the event box window is positioned above the windows of its
   --  child, as opposed to below it. If the window is above, all events inside
   --  the event box will go to the event box. If the window is below, events
   --  in windows of child widgets will first got to that widget, and then to
   --  its parents.
   --  The default is to keep the window below the child.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "above_child": True if the event box window is above its child

   function Get_Visible_Window
      (Event_Box : not null access Gtk_Event_Box_Record) return Boolean;
   --  Returns whether the event box has a visible window. See
   --  Gtk.Event_Box.Set_Visible_Window for details.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4

   procedure Set_Visible_Window
      (Event_Box      : not null access Gtk_Event_Box_Record;
       Visible_Window : Boolean);
   --  Set whether the event box uses a visible or invisible child window. The
   --  default is to use visible windows.
   --  In an invisible window event box, the window that the event box creates
   --  is a Gdk.Input_Only window, which means that it is invisible and only
   --  serves to receive events.
   --  A visible window event box creates a visible (Gdk.Input_Output) window
   --  that acts as the parent window for all the widgets contained in the
   --  event box.
   --  You should generally make your event box invisible if you just want to
   --  trap events. Creating a visible window may cause artifacts that are
   --  visible to the user, especially if the user is using a theme with
   --  gradients or pixmaps.
   --  The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if you want to
   --  set the background to a different color or draw on it.
   --  Note:
   --  There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has its
   --  window below the child. (See Gtk.Event_Box.Set_Above_Child.) Since the
   --  input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windows that
   --  descendent widgets of the event box create, events on these windows
   --  aren't propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+. The
   --  practical effect of this is if an event isn't in the event mask for the
   --  descendant window (see Gtk.Widget.Add_Events), it won't be received by
   --  the event box.
   --  This problem doesn't occur for visible event boxes, because in that
   --  case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the descendant
   --  windows, not just at the same place on the screen.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "visible_window": True to make the event box have a visible window
