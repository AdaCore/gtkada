--  <description>
--  This widget is a container that catches events for its child when its
--  child does not have its own window (like a Gtk_Scrolled_Window or a
--  Gtk_Label for instance). Some widgets in GtkAda do not have their own
--  window, and thus can not directly get events from the server. The
--  Gtk_Event_Box widget can be used to force its child to receive events
--  anyway.
-- 
--  For instance, this widget is used internally in a Gtk_Combo_Box so that
--  the application can change the cursor when the mouse is in the popup
--  window. In that case, it contains a frame, that itself contains the
--  scrolled window of the popup.

   procedure Set_Above_Child
      (Event_Box   : access Gtk_Event_Box_Record;
       Above_Child : Boolean);
   --  Set whether the event box window is positioned above the windows of its
   --  child, as opposed to below it. If the window is above, all events inside
   --  the event box will go to the event box. If the window is below, events
   --  in windows of child widgets will first got to that widget, and then to
   --  its parents. The default is to keep the window below the child.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "above_child": True if the event box window is above the windows of its
   --  child

   function Get_Visible_Window
      (Event_Box : access Gtk_Event_Box_Record) return Boolean;
   procedure Set_Visible_Window
      (Event_Box      : access Gtk_Event_Box_Record;
       Visible_Window : Boolean);
   --  Set whether the event box uses a visible or invisible child window. The
   --  default is to use visible windows. In an invisible window event box, the
   --  window that the event box creates is a %GDK_INPUT_ONLY window, which
   --  means that it is invisible and only serves to receive events. A visible
   --  window event box creates a visible (%GDK_INPUT_OUTPUT) window that acts
   --  as the parent window for all the widgets contained in the event box. You
   --  should generally make your event box invisible if you just want to trap
   --  events. Creating a visible window may cause artifacts that are visible
   --  to the user, especially if the user is using a theme with gradients or
   --  pixmaps. The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if you
   --  want to set the background to a different color or draw on it.
   --  Note: There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has
   --  its window below the child. (See Gtk.Event_Box.Set_Above_Child.) Since
   --  the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windows that
   --  descendent widgets of the event box create, events on these windows
   --  aren't propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+. The
   --  practical effect of this is if an event isn't in the event mask for the
   --  descendant window (see Gtk.Widget.Add_Event), it won't be received by
   --  the event box.
   --  This problem doesn't occur for visible event boxes, because in that
   --  case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the descendant
   --  windows, not just at the same place on the screen.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "visible_window": boolean value
