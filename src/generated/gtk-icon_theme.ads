--  <description>
--  Gtk.Icon_Theme.Gtk_Icon_Theme provides a facility for looking up icons by
--  name and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
--  providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used depending on
--  what 'icon theme' is selected by the user. The operation of icon themes on
--  Linux and Unix follows the <ulink
--  url="http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec">Icon Theme
--  Specification</ulink>. There is a default icon theme, named 'hicolor' where
--  applications should install their icons, but more additional application
--  themes can be installed as operating system vendors and users choose.
--
--  Named icons are similar to the <xref
--  linkend="gtk3-Themeable-Stock-Images"/> facility, and the distinction
--  between the two may be a bit confusing. A few things to keep in mind:
--
--     * Stock images usually are used in conjunction with <xref
--  linkend="gtk3-Stock-Items"/>, such as GTK_STOCK_OK or GTK_STOCK_OPEN. Named
--  icons are easier to set up and therefore are more useful for new icons that
--  an application wants to add, such as application icons or window icons.
--
--     * Stock images can only be loaded at the symbolic sizes defined by the
--  Gtk.Enums.Gtk_Icon_Size enumeration, or by custom sizes defined by
--  Gtk.Icon_Factory.Icon_Size_Register, while named icons are more flexible
--  and any pixel size can be specified.
--
--     * Because stock images are closely tied to stock items, and thus to
--  actions in the user interface, stock images may come in multiple variants
--  for different widget states or writing directions.
--
--  A good rule of thumb is that if there is a stock image for what you want
--  to use, use it, otherwise use a named icon. It turns out that internally
--  stock images are generally defined in terms of one or more named icons. (An
--  example of the more than one case is icons that depend on writing
--  direction; GTK_STOCK_GO_FORWARD uses the two themed icons
--  "gtk-stock-go-forward-ltr" and "gtk-stock-go-forward-rtl".)
--
--  In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via Gtk.Image.Gtk_Image
--  or stock items, rather than directly, but looking up icons directly is also
--  simple. The Gtk.Icon_Theme.Gtk_Icon_Theme object acts as a database of all
--  the icons in the current theme. You can create new
--  Gtk.Icon_Theme.Gtk_Icon_Theme objects, but it's much more efficient to use
--  the standard icon theme for the Gdk.Screen.Gdk_Screen so that the icon
--  information is shared with other people looking up icons. In the case where
--  the default screen is being used, looking up an icon can be as simple as:
--
--    GError *error = NULL;
--    GtkIconTheme *icon_theme;
--    GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;
--    icon_theme = gtk_icon_theme_get_default ();
--    pixbuf = gtk_icon_theme_load_icon (icon_theme,
--       "my-icon-name", // icon name
--       48, // size
--       0,  // flags
--       &error);
--    if (!pixbuf)
--    {
--       g_warning ("Couldn't load icon: %s", error->message);
--       g_error_free (error);
--    }
-- else
--    {
--       // Use the pixbuf
--       g_object_unref (pixbuf);
--    }

   --  theme, instead of scaled appropriately for the pixbuf returned by
   --  Gtk.Icon_Theme.Load_Icon.
   --  Raw coordinates are somewhat strange; they are specified to be with
   --  respect to the unscaled pixmap for PNG and XPM icons, but for SVG icons,
   --  they are in a 1000x1000 coordinate space that is scaled to the final
   --  size of the icon. You can determine if the icon is an SVG icon by using
   --  Gtk.Icon_Theme.Get_Filename, and seeing if it is non-null and ends in
   --  '.svg'.
   --  This function is provided primarily to allow compatibility wrappers for
   --  older API's, and is not expected to be useful for applications.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "raw_coordinates": whether the coordinates of embedded rectangles and
   --  attached points should be returned in their original (unscaled) form.

   procedure Add_Builtin_Icon
      (Icon_Name : UTF8_String;
       Size      : Gint;
       Pixbuf    : not null access Gdk.Pixbuf.Gdk_Pixbuf_Record'Class);
   --  Registers a built-in icon for icon theme lookups. The idea of built-in
   --  icons is to allow an application or library that uses themed icons to
   --  function requiring files to be present in the file system. For instance,
   --  the default images for all of GTK+'s stock icons are registered as
   --  built-icons.
   --  In general, if you use Gtk.Icon_Theme.Add_Builtin_Icon you should also
   --  install the icon in the icon theme, so that the icon is generally
   --  available.
   --  This function will generally be used with pixbufs loaded via
   --  gdk_pixbuf_new_from_inline.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "icon_name": the name of the icon to register
   --  "size": the size at which to register the icon (different images can be
   --  registered for the same icon name at different sizes.)
   --  "pixbuf": Gdk.Pixbuf.Gdk_Pixbuf that contains the image to use for
   --  Icon_Name.

   --  not previously been called for the given screen, a new icon theme object
   --  will be created and associated with the screen. Icon theme objects are
   --  fairly expensive to create, so using this function is usually a better
   --  choice than calling than Gtk.Icon_Theme.Gtk_New and setting the screen
   --  yourself; by using this function a single icon theme object will be
   --  shared between users.
   --  Since: gtk+ 2.4
   --  "screen": a Gdk.Screen.Gdk_Screen
