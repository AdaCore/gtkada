   --  You will not usually need to call this function directly.
   --  While you should not call this function directly, you might want to
   --  know how exactly events are handled. So here is what this function does
   --  with the event:
   --     * Compress enter/leave notify events. If the event passed build an
   --  enter/leave pair together with the next event (peeked from GDK), both
   --  events are thrown away. This is to avoid a backlog of (de-)highlighting
   --  widgets crossed by the pointer.
   --     * Find the widget which got the event. If the widget can't be
   --  determined the event is thrown away unless it belongs to a INCR
   --  transaction.
   --     * Then the event is pushed onto a stack so you can query the
   --  currently handled event with Gtk.Main.Get_Current_Event.
   --     * The event is sent to a widget. If a grab is active all events for
   --  widgets that are not in the contained in the grab widget are sent to the
   --  latter with a few exceptions:
   --     * Deletion and destruction events are still sent to the event widget
   --  for obvious reasons.
   --     * Events which directly relate to the visual representation of the
   --  event widget.
   --     * Leave events are delivered to the event widget if there was an
   --  enter event delivered to it before without the paired leave event.
   --     * Drag events are not redirected because it is unclear what the
   --  semantics of that would be. Another point of interest might be that all
   --  key events are first passed through the key snooper functions if there
   --  are any. Read the description of Gtk.Main.Key_Snooper_Install if you
   --  need this feature.
   --     * After finishing the delivery the event is popped from the event
   --  stack.
