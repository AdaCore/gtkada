package Gtk is

   function Major_Version return Guint;
   --  Return the major version number for Gtk+ that was linked.
   --  Note that this is not necessarily the same as for GtkAda. It could also
   --  be different when your application is running, if the dynamic linker
   --  find some other GtkAda library. Use Gtk.Main.Check_Version to ensure
   --  that the two versions are compatible
   --  If the version is 1.2.6, returns 1.

   function Minor_Version return Guint;
   --  Return the minor version number for Gtk+.
   --  Note that this is not necessarily the same as for GtkAda.
   --  If the version is 1.2.6, returns 2.

   function Micro_Version return Guint;
   --  Return the micro version number for Gtk+.
   --  Note that this is not necessarily the same as for GtkAda.
   --  If the version is 1.2.6, returns 6.

   subtype Gtk_Type is Glib.GType;
   --  Renaming used for compatiblity.
   --  Note: Gtk_Type_* constants have been replaced by GType_* constants
   --  in Glib.

   type Gtk_Notebook_Page is new Glib.C_Proxy;
   --  A page of the notebook.
   --  It can contain a single child, and is also associated with a tab
   --  label used to select that page in the notebook.
