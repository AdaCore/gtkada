--  <description>
--  This widget implements a top level window.
--  It is used as the base class for dialogs, ...
--
--  A window has both a default widget (to which events are sent if no other
--  widget has been selected and has the focus), and a focus widget (which
--  gets the events and overrides the default widget).
--
--  You can set many hints on the window (its minimum and maximum size, its
--  decoration, etc.) but these are only hints to the window manager, which
--  might not respect them.
--
--  A useful hint, respected by most window managers, can be used to force
--  some secondary windows to stay on top of the main window on the screen
--  (for instance, so that a smaller window can not be hidden by a bigger
--  one). See the function Set_Transient_For below.
--
--  A window can also be modal, i.e. grab all the mouse and keyboard events
--  in the application while it is displayed.

   --  real main window has been shown, for example.
   --
   --  In that example, you would disable startup notification temporarily,
   --  show your splash screen, then re-enable it so that showing the main

   --  is 200, the window manager will indicate a width of -400.
   --
   --  If your window manager respects the hints (and its doesn't have to),
   --  then the user will never be able to resize the window to a size not
   --  in Geometry.Min_* .. Geometry.Max_*.
   --
   --  Geometry.*_Inc specifies by which amount the size will be multiplied.
   --  For instance, if Width_Inc = 50 and the size reported by the Window
   --  Manager is 2x3, then the actual width of the window is 100.
   --  Your window's size will always be a multiple of the *_Inc values.

   --  currently open, and the user chooses Preferences from the menu
   --  a second time; use Present to move the already-open dialog

   -- Position --
   --------------

   procedure Move (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record; X, Y : Gint);
   --  Asks the window manager to move Window to the given position. Window
   --  managers are free to ignore this; most window managers ignore requests
   --  for initial window positions (instead using a user-defined placement
   --  algorithm) and honor requests after the window has already been shown.
   --
   --  Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determined reference
   --  point for the window. The gravity determines two things: first, the
   --  location of the reference point in root window coordinates; and second,
   --  which point on the window is positioned at the reference point.
   --
   --  By default the gravity is GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the reference point is
   --  simply the (x, y) supplied to Move. The top-left corner of the window
   --  decorations (aka window frame or border) will be placed at (x, y).
   --  Therefore, to position a window at the top left of the screen, you want
   --  to use the default gravity (which is GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the
   --  window to 0,0.
   --
   --  To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you would
   --  set GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the reference point is at x +
   --  the window width and y + the window height, and the bottom-right corner
   --  of the window border will be placed at that reference point. So, to
   --  place a window in the bottom right corner you would first set gravity to
   --  south east, then write:
   --    Move (Window, Gdk_Screen_Width  - Window_Width,
   --                  Gdk_Screen_Height - Window_Height);

   procedure Set_Position
     (Window   : access Gtk_Window_Record;
      Position : Gtk.Enums.Gtk_Window_Position);
   --  Specify how the position of the window should be computed.
   --  If Position is Win_Pos_Center_Always or Win_Pos_Center, then the window
   --  is centered on the screen. In the first case, it is also recentered
   --  when the window is resized with Gtk.Widget.Set_Usize (ie except on
   --  user action).
   --  If Position is Win_Pos_Mouse, then the window is positioned so that it
   --  centered around the mouse.
   --  If Position is Win_Pos_None, no calculation is done. If
   --  Gtk.Widget.Set_Uposition as been called, it is respected. This is the
   --  default case.

   procedure Get_Position
     (Window         : access Gtk_Window_Record;
      Root_X, Root_Y : out Gint);
   --  This function returns the position you need to pass to gtk.window.move
   --  to keep Window in its current position. This means that the meaning of
   --  the returned value varies with window gravity. See Gtk.Window.Move for
   --  more details.
   --
   --  If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
   --  GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that Get_Position gets the position of
   --  the top-left corner of the window manager frame for the window.
   --  gtk.window.move sets the position of this same top-left corner.
   --
   --  Get_Position is not 100% reliable because the X Window System does not
   --  specify a way to obtain the geometry of the decorations placed on a
   --  window by the window manager. Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that
   --  works with most window managers.
   --
   --  Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with
   --  respect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window to its
   --  current position as returned by Get_Position tends to result in moving
   --  the window slightly. Window managers are slowly getting better over
   --  time.
   --
   --  If a window has gravity GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager frame is not
   --  relevant, and thus Get_Position will always produce accurate results.
   --  However you can't use static gravity to do things like place a window in
   --  a corner of the screen, because static gravity ignores the window
   --  manager decorations.
   --
   --  If you are saving and restoring your application's window positions, you
   --  should know that it's impossible for applications to do this without
   --  getting it somewhat wrong because applications do not have sufficient
   --  knowledge of window manager state. The Correct Mechanism is to support
   --  the session management protocol (see the "GnomeClient" object in the
   --  GNOME libraries for example) and allow the window manager to save your
   --  window sizes and positions.

   --  Starts moving a window. This function is used if an application has
   --  window movement grips. When GDK can support it, the window movement will

   --  not all that well, depending on the windowing system.

   --  for X (type 'man X') for details on this. Parse_Geometry does work on
   --  all GTK+ ports including Win32 but is primarily intended for an X
   --  environment.
   --
   --  If either a size or a position can be extracted from the geometry
   --  string, Parse_Geometry returns True and calls Set_Default_Size and/or
   --  Move to resize/move the window.
   --
   --  If Parse_Geometry returns True, it will also set the HINT_USER_POS
   --  and/or HINT_USER_SIZE hints indicating to the window manager that the
   --  size/position of the window was user-specified. This causes most window
   --  managers to honor the geometry.
   --
   --  Note that for Parse_Geometry to work as expected, it has to be called
   --  when the window has its "final" size, i.e. after calling Show_All on the
   --  contents and Set_Geometry_Hints on the window.

   --
   --  See Gdk_Gravity for full details. To briefly summarize,

   procedure Get_Default_Size
     (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record;
      Width  : out Gint;
      Height : out Gint);
   --  Sets the default size of a window. If the window's "natural" size (its
   --  size request) is larger than the default, the default will be
   --  ignored. More generally, if the default size does not obey the geometry
   --  hints for the window (Set_Geometry_Hints can be used to set these
   --  explicitly), the default size will be clamped to the nearest permitted
   --  size.
   --
   --  Unlike Gtk.Widget.Set_Size_Request, which sets a size request for a
   --  widget and thus would keep users from shrinking the window, this
   --  function only sets the initial size, just as if the user had resized the
   --  window themselves. Users can still shrink the window again as they
   --  normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to use the "natural"
   --  default size (the size request of the window).
   --
   --  For more control over a window's initial size and how resizing works,
   --  investigate Set_Geometry_Hints.
   --
   --  For some uses, Resize is a more appropriate function.  Resize changes
   --  the current size of the window, rather than the size to be used on
   --  initial display. Resize always affects the window itself, not the
   --  geometry widget.
   --
   --  The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is
   --  shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size it
   --  had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.
   --
   --  Windows can't actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
   --  passing 0 for Width and Height is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.
   --
   --  This has no effect on Popup windows (set in call to Gtk_New).

   procedure Resize
     (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record;
      Width, Height : Gint);
   --  Resize the window as if the user had done so, obeying geometry
   --  constraints. The default geometry constraint is that windows may
   --  not be smaller than their size request; to override this
   --  constraint, call Gtk.Widget.Set_Size_Request to set the window's
   --  request to a smaller value.
   --
   --  If Resize is called before showing a window for the -- first time, it
   --  overrides any default size set with -- Set_Default_Size.
   --
   --  Windows may not be resized smaller than 1 by 1 pixels. However, as a
   --  special case, if both Width and Height are set to -1, the best requested
   --  size is recomputed for the window, and used.

   procedure Get_Size
     (Window        : access Gtk_Window_Record;
      Width, Height : out Gint);
   --  Obtains the current size of Window. If Window is not onscreen, it
   --  returns the size GTK+ will suggest to the window manager for the initial
   --  window size (but this is not reliably the same as the size the window
   --  manager will actually select). The size obtained by Get_Size is the last
   --  size received in Gdk_Event_Configure, that is, GTK+ uses its
   --  locally-stored size, rather than querying the X server for the size. As
   --  a result, if you call Resize then immediately call Get_Size, the size
   --  won't have taken effect yet. After the window manager processes the
   --  resize request, GTK+ receives notification that the size has changed via
   --  a configure event, and the size of the window gets updated.
   --
   --  Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race condition,
   --  because the size of the window may change between the time that you get
   --  the size and the time that you perform some action assuming that size is
   --  the current size. To avoid race conditions, connect to "configure_event"
   --  on the window and adjust your size-dependent state to match the size
   --  delivered in the Gdk_Event_Configure.
   --
   --  Note 2: The returned size does *not* include the size of the window
   --  manager decorations (aka the window frame or border). Those are not
   --  drawn by GTK+ and GTK+ has no reliable method of determining their size.
   --
   --  Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to position the window
   --  onscreen, there may be a better way. The preferred way is to simply set
   --  the window's semantic type with Set_Type_Hint, which allows the window
   --  manager to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of
   --  dialogs with Set_Transient_For window managers will often center the
   --  dialog over its parent window. It's much preferred to let the window
   --  manager handle these things rather than doing it yourself, because all
   --  apps will behave consistently and according to user prefs if the window
   --  manager handles it. Also, the window manager can take the size of the
   --  window decorations/border into account, while your application cannot.
   --
   --  In any case, if you insist on application-specified window positioning,
   --  there's *still*> a better way than doing it yourself - Set_Position will
   --  frequently handle the details for you.

   --  <signals>
   --  The following new signals are defined for this widget:
   --
   --  - "set_focus"
   --    procedure Handler (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record'Class;
   --                       Widget : access Gtk_Widget_Record'Class);
   --    Called when the widget that has the focus has changed.
   --    This widget gets all keyboard events that happen in the window.
   --    You should not block the emission of this signal, since most of
   --    the work is done in the default handler.
   --
   --  - "frame_event"
   --    function Handler
   --      (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record'Class;
   --       Event  : Gdk.Event.Gdk_Event) return Boolean;
   --    If this function is called on a window before it is realized
   --    or showed it will have a "frame" window around widget-window.
   --    Called when the "frame" window set around a window receives events.
   --    This is mainly used by the linux-fb port to implement managed
   --    windows, but it could concievably be used by X-programs that
   --    want to do their own window decorations.
   --
   --  - "activate_focus"
   --    procedure Handler (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record'Class);
   --    You should emit this signal to request that the currently focused
   --    widget receives the "activate" signal. This is the same as calling
   --    Activate_Focus, but can be bound to a key binding
   --
   --  - "activate_default"
   --    procedure Handler (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record'Class);
   --    Same as Activate_Default, but can be bound to a key binding
   --
   --  - "move_focus"
   --    procedure Handler
   --       (Window    : access Gtk_Window_Record'Class;
   --        Direction : Gtk_Direction_Type);
   --    Emitted when a new child gains the focus
   --
   --  - "keys_changed"
   --    procedure Handler (Window : access Gtk_Window_Record'Class);
   --    Emitted when the key accelerators or mnemonics are changed for the
   --    window.
