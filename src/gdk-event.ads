--  This package provides functions dealing with events from the window system.
--  In GtkAda applications, the events are handled automatically in
--  Gtk.Main.Do_Event, and passed on to the appropriate widgets, so these
--  functions are rarely needed.
--
--  !! Warning !! This is one of the only package that requires manual
--  memory management in some cases. If you use the function Allocate,
--  you have to use the function Free too...

   -----------------------
   -- General functions --
   -----------------------

   function Get_Type return GType;
   --  Return the type corresponding to a Gdk_Event.

   procedure Deep_Copy (From : Gdk_Event; To : out Gdk_Event);
   --  Deep copy for an event. The C structure is itself duplicated.
   --  You need to deallocated it yourself with a call to Free below.

   procedure Get_Graphics_Expose
     (Event  : out Gdk_Event_Expose;
      Window : Gdk.Gdk_Window);
   --  Waits for a GraphicsExpose or NoExpose event
   --  If it gets a GraphicsExpose event, it returns a pointer to it,
   --  otherwise it returns an event for which Is_Created is False.
   --
   --  This function can be used to implement scrolling: you must call
   --  Gdk.GC.Set_Exposures with True on the GC you are using for the
   --  drawing, so that a events are generated for obscured areas and every
   --  time a new part of the widget is drawn. However, there is a race
   --  condition if multiple scrolls happen before you have finished
   --  processing the first one. A workaround is to call Get_Graphics_Expose
   --  after every scroll until it returns a null event.

   function Events_Pending return Boolean;
   --  Is there any event pending on the queue ?

   procedure Get (Event : out Gdk_Event);
   --  Get the next event on the queue.

   procedure Peek (Event : out Gdk_Event);
   --  Look at the next event on the queue, but leave if there.

   procedure Put (Event : Gdk_Event);
   --  Add an event on the queue - Better to use Gtk.Signal.Emit_By_Name

   procedure Set_Show_Events (Show_Events : Boolean := True);
   --  For debug purposes, you can choose whether you want to see the events
   --  GtkAda receives.

   function Get_Show_Events return Boolean;
   --  Return the current state of Show_Events.

   procedure Send_Client_Message_To_All (Event : Gdk_Event);
   --  Low level routine to send an Event to every window.

   function Send_Client_Message
     (Event : Gdk_Event;
      Xid   : Guint32) return Boolean;
   --  Low level routine to send an Event to a specified X window.

   procedure Allocate

      Event_Type : Gdk_Event_Type;
      Window     : Gdk.Gdk_Window);
   --  Create an event, whose fields are uninitialized.
   --  You need to use the function Set_* above to modify them, before you can
   --  send the event with Emit_By_Name.
   --  !!Note!!: The event has to be freed if you have called this function.
   --  Use the function Free below.

   procedure Free (Event : in out Gdk_Event);
   --  Free the memory (and C structure) associated with an event.
   --  You need to call this function only if the event was created through
   --  Allocate, not if it was created by GtkAda itself (or you would get
   --  a segmentation fault).

   --  This function should dispatch all the events properly, since it replaces
   --  completly the default event handler. However, it can call
   --  Gtk.Main.Do_Event to take care of the events it does not know how to
   --  handle.
   --  See also Gtk.Main.Get_Event_Widget to get the widget from the event.

   procedure Event_Handler_Set
     (Func : Event_Handler_Func; Data : System.Address);
   --  Set up a new event handler.
   --  This handler replaces the default GtkAda event handler, and thus should
   --  make sure that all events are correctly handled.
   --
   --  Note that managing the memory for Data is your responsability, and
   --  Data is passed as is to Func.

   function From_Address (C : System.Address) return Gdk_Event;
   --  Convert a C handler to the matching Event structure.

   function To_Address (C : Gdk_Event) return System.Address;
   --  Convert an event to the underlying C handler.

   function Is_Created (E : Gdk_Event) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if the underlying C event has been created.
