--  <description>
--  Gtk_Bindings provides a mechanism for configuring Gtk+ key bindings through
--  RC files. This eases key binding adjustments for application developers as
--  well as users and provides Gtk+ users or administrators with high key
--  binding configurability which requires no application or toolkit side
--  changes.
--
--  Installing a key binding
--  ========================
--
--  A resource file binding consists of a 'binding' definition and a match
--  statement to apply the binding to specific widget types. Details on the
--  matching mechanism are described under Pathnames and patterns. Inside the
--  binding definition, key combinations are bound to specific signal emissions
--  on the target widget. Key combinations are strings consisting of an
--  optional Gdk_Modifier_Type name and key names such as those defined in
--  Gdk.Types.Keysyms or returned from gdk_keyval_name(), they have to be
--  parsable by gtk_accelerator_parse(). Specifications of signal emissions
--  consist of a string identifying the signal name, and a list of signal
--  specific arguments in parenthesis. For example for binding Control and the
--  left or right cursor keys of a Gtk_Entry widget to the
--  Gtk_Entry::move-cursor signal, so movement occurs in 3 letter steps, the
--  following binding can be used:
--
--  binding "MoveCursor3" {
--     bind "<Control>Right" {
--       "move-cursor" (visual-positions, 3, 0)
--     }
--     bind "<Control>Left" {
--       "move-cursor" (visual-positions, -3, 0)
--     }
--  }
--  class "GtkEntry" binding "MoveCursor3"
--
--  Unbinding existing key bindings
--  ===============================
--
--  Gtk+ already defines a number of useful bindings for the widgets it
--  provides. Because custom bindings set up in RC files take precedence over
--  the default bindings shipped with Gtk+, overriding existing bindings as
--  demonstrated in Installing a key binding works as expected. The same
--  mechanism can not be used to "unbind" existing bindings, however.
--
--  binding "MoveCursor3" {
--     bind "<Control>Right" { }
--     bind "<Control>Left" { }
--  }
--  class "GtkEntry" binding "MoveCursor3"
--
--  The above example will not have the desired effect of causing
--  "<Control>Right" and "<Control>Left" key presses to be ignored by Gtk+.
--  Instead, it just causes any existing bindings from the bindings set
--  "MoveCursor3" to be deleted, so when "<Control>Right" or "<Control>Left"
--  are pressed, no binding for these keys is found in binding set
--  "MoveCursor3". Gtk+ will thus continue to search for matching key bindings,
--  and will eventually lookup and find the default Gtk+ bindings for entries
--  which implement word movement. To keep Gtk+ from activating its default
--  bindings, the "unbind" keyword can be used like this:
--
--  binding "MoveCursor3" {
--     unbind "<Control>Right"
--     unbind "<Control>Left"
--  }
--  class "GtkEntry" binding "MoveCursor3"
--
--  Now, Gtk+ will find a match when looking up "<Control>Right" and
--  "<Control>Left" key presses before it resorts to its default bindings, and
--  the match instructs it to abort ("unbind") the search, so the key presses
--  are not consumed by this widget. As usual, further processing of the key
--  presses, e.g. by an entries parent widget, is now possible.
