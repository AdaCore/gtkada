--  <description>
--  This package provides an interface implemented by Gtk.File_Chooser_Widget
--  and Gtk.File_Chooser_Button, and by your own file selection widgets if you
--  wish to expose a standard interface.
--
--  Gtk_File_Chooser allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
--  In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It may
--  be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various sources
--  and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:
--    - Bookmarks
--      are created by the user, by dragging folders from the right pane to the
--      left pane, or by using the "Add". Bookmarks can be renamed and deleted
--      by the user.
--    - Shortcuts
--      can be provided by the application or by the underlying filesystem
--      abstraction (e.g. both the gnome-vfs and the Windows filesystems
--      provide "Desktop" shortcuts). Shortcuts cannot be modified by the user.
--    - Volumes
--      are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are the
--      "roots" of the filesystem.
--
--  File Names and Encodings
--
--  When the user is finished selecting files in a Gtk_File_Chooser, your
--  program can get the selected names either as filenames or as URIs. For
--  URIs, the normal escaping rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII
--  characters. However, filenames are always returned in the character set
--  specified by the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable. Please see the
--  Glib documentation for more details about this variable.
--
--  Important: This means that while you can pass the result of
--  Get_Filename to low-level file system primitives , you will need to convert
--  it to UTF-8 before using it in a Gtk_Label for instance. Conversion is done
--  through Glib.Convert.Filename_To_UTF8.
--
--  You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then get
--  notification about when the preview needs to be updated. To install a
--  preview widget, use gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget(). Then, connect to
--  the GtkFileChooser::update-preview signal to get notified when you need to
--  update the contents of the preview.
--
--  Preview widgets
--
--  You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then get
--  notification about when the preview needs to be updated. To install a
--  preview widget, use Set_Preview_Widget. Then, connect to the
--  GtkFileChooser::update-preview signal to get notified when you need to
--  update the contents of the preview.
--
--  Your callback should use Get_Preview_Filename to see what needs previewing.
--  Once you have generated the preview for the corresponding file, you must
--  call Set_Preview_Widget_Active with a boolean flag that indicates whether
--  your callback could successfully generate a preview.
--
--  Adding Extra Widgets

--  You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options that are not
--  present in the default design. For example, you can add a toggle button to
--  give the user the option to open a file in read-only mode. You can use
--  Set_Extra_Widget to insert additional widgets in a file chooser.
--
--  If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file chooser, you can
--  a container such as a GtkVBox or a GtkTable and include your widgets in it.
--  Then, set the container as the whole extra widget.
--
--  Key bindings
--
--  The following default key bindings are provided, but you can use a gtkrc
--  file to override them if you need (see gtk-rc.ads).
--     Signal name    | Key binding
--     location-popup | Control-L  (empty path)
--                    | /          (path of "/")
--                    | ~          (home directory)
--     up-folder      | Alt-Up  or backspace
--     down-folder    | Alt-Down
--     home-folder    | Alt-Home
--     desktop-folder | Alt-D
--     quick-bookmark | Alt-1 through Alt-0

   --  <signals>
   --  The following new signals are defined for this widget:
   --
   --  - "confirm-overwrite"
   --    function Handler
   --        (Chooser : Gtk_File_Chooser) return File_Chooser_Confirmation;
   --    This signal gets emitted whenever it is appropriate to present a
   --    confirmation dialog when the user has selected a file name that
   --    already exists. The signal only gets emitted when the file chooser is
   --    in Action_Save mode.
   --    Most applications just need to turn on the do-overwrite-confirmation
   --    property (or call the Set_Do_Overwrite_Confirmation function), and
   --    they will automatically get a stock confirmation dialog. Applications
   --    which need to customize this behavior should do that, and also connect
   --    to the confirm-overwrite signal.
   --    A signal handler for this signal must return a value which indicates
   --    the action to take. If the handler determines that the user wants to
   --    select a different filename, it should return
   --    Confirmation_Select_Again. If it determines that the user is satisfied
   --    with his choice of file name, it should return
   --    Confirmation_Accept_Filename. On the other hand, if it determines that
   --    the stock confirmation dialog should be used, it should return
   --    Confirmation_Confir.
   --
   --  - "current-folder-changed"
   --    procedure Handler (Chooser : Gtk_File_Chooser);
   --    This signal is emitted when the current folder in a Gtk_File_Chooser
   --    changes. This can happen due to the user performing some action that
   --    changes folders, such as selecting a bookmark or visiting a folder on
   --    the file list. It can also happen as a result of calling a function to
   --    explicitly change the current folder in a file chooser.
   --    Normally you do not need to connect to this signal, unless you need to
   --    keep track of which folder a file chooser is showing.
   --
   --  - "file-activated"
   --    procedure Handler (Chooser : Gtk_File_Chooser);
   --    This signal is emitted when the user "activates" a file in the file
   --    chooser. This can happen by double-clicking on a file in the file
   --    list, or by pressing Enter.
   --    Normally you do not need to connect to this signal. It is used
   --    internally by Gtk_File_Chooser_Dialog to know when to activate the
   --    default button in the dialog.
   --
   --  - "selection-changed"
   --    procedure Handler (Chooser : Gtk_File_Chooser);
   --    This signal is emitted when there is a change in the set of selected
   --    files in a Gtk_File_Chooser. This can happen when the user modifies
   --    the selection with the mouse or the keyboard, or when explicitly
   --    calling functions to change the selection.
   --    Normally you do not need to connect to this signal, as it is easier to
   --    wait for the file chooser to finish running, and then to get the list
   --    of selected files using the functions mentioned below.
   --
   --  - "update-preview"
   --    procedure Handler (Chooser : Gtk_File_Chooser);
   --    This signal is emitted when the preview in a file chooser should be
   --    regenerated. For example, this can happen when the currently selected
   --    file changes. You should use this signal if you want your file chooser
   --    to have a preview widget.
   --    Once you have installed a preview widget with Set_Preview_Widget, you
   --    should update it when this signal is emitted. You can use the
   --    functions Get_Preview_Filename or Get_Preview_Uri to get the name of
   --    the file to preview. Your widget may not be able to preview all kinds
   --    of files; your callback must call Set_Preview_Wiget_Active to inform
   --    the file chooser about whether the preview was generated successfully
   --    or not.
