   --  menu from the XML file, but not the window it is embedded
   --  in. Note also that the XML parse tree is cached to speed up
   --  creating another GladeXML object for the same file.

   --  Domain, if not null, is the international domain to use for
   --  string translation. See Gtkada.Intl for more information.

   --  This function is used to get a list of Gtk_Widgets with names
