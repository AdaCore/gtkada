   -- Drawing the background --
   ----------------------------
   --  Various subprograms that draw the background of a view.
   --  By default, a view only displays a white background, but you can
   --  override the Draw_Internal primitive and call one of the following
   --  subprograms if you want to draw alternate backgrounds.
   --
   --  You could also use an image as the background, by creating a
   --  cairo pattern:
   --     Surf    : Cairo_Surface := Cairo.Png.Create_From_Png ("file.png");
   --     Pattern : Cairo_Pattern := Cairo.Pattern.Create_For_Surface (Surf);
   --     Cairo.Pattern.Set_Extend (Pattern, Cairo_Extend_Repeat);
   --     Destroy (Surf);
   --  and then drawing that pattern.
   --     Set_Source (Context.Cr, Pattern);
   --     Paint (Context.Cr);
   --  With that code, the image will be scrolled when the canvas is scrolled.
   --  If you do not want to scroll it, you need to set the identity matrix as
   --  the transformation matrix.
   --
   --  Using a custom background color can be done with:
   --     Set_Source_Rgb (Context.Cr, Red, Green, Blue);
   --     Paint (Context.Cr);

   --  Draw a grid with lines in the background.
   --  The size of the grid can be set with Gtkada.Canvas_View.Set_Grid_Size.
