--  <description>
--  This object adds support for opening files from OS commands, using the
--  standard Glib Application mechanism for opening those files.
--
--  This requires some support that is system-specific:
--
--  On windows, this registers a DDE server using the application's Id as name.
--  So for example com.adacore.TestGtk will register a DDE server whose name
--  is TestGtk.
--
--  On OSX, this requires the application to be part of a bundle. This bundle
--  needs to declare the file patterns that are supported by the application.
