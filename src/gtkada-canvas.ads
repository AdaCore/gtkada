--  <description>
--  This package provides an interactive canvas, on which the user can put
--  items, move them with the mouse, etc. The items can be connected together,
--  and the connections remain active while the items are moved.
--
--  It also supports scrolling if put in a Gtk_Scrolled_Window.
--  The canvas will be scrolled (and the selected items moved) if an item is
--  selected and the mouse is dragged on a small area on the side of the canvas
--  or even directly outside of the canvas. Scrolling will continue until the
--  mouse is either released or moved back inside the canvas.
--
--  The scrolling speed will slightly increase over time if the mouse is kept
--  outside of the canvas. This makes the canvas much more comfortable to use
--  for the user.
--
--  All items put in this canvas must inherit from the type Canvas_Item_Record.
--  However, it is your responsability, as a programmer, to provide drawing
--  routines. In fact, all these items should draw in a pixmap, which is then
--  copied automatically to the screen whenever the canvas needs to redraw
--  itself.
--
--  The items can also react to mouse events: mouse clicks are transmitted to
--  the item if the mouse did not move more than a given amount of pixels.
--  To decide what their reaction should be, you should override the
--  On_Button_Click subprogram.
--
--  This canvas is not intended for cases where you want to put hundreds of
--  items on the screen. For instance, it does not provide any smart
--  double-buffering other than the one provided by gtk+ itself, and thus you
--  would get some flicker if there are too many items.
--
--  There are three coordinate systems used by widget. All the subprograms
--  expect a specific coordinate system as input or output. Here are the three
--  systems:
--    - World coordinates
--      The position of an item is reported in pixels, as if the canvas
--      currently had a zoom level of 100%. This is fully independent, at any
--      time, from the current zoom level of the canvas.
--      Since the canvas is considered to expand ad infinitum, the top-left
--      corner doesn't have any specific fixed coordinates. It can be known by
--      checking the current lower value of the adjustments (aka scrollbars).
--
--    - Canvas coordinates
--      This is similar to world coordinates, except these depend on the
--      current zoom level of the canvas. This also affect the width and height
--      of the objects in the canvas.
--      The subprograms To_Canvas_Coordinates and To_World_Coordinates can be
--      used to convert lengths from world to canvas coordinates.
--      The same behavior as world coordinates applies for the top-left corner.
--      All drawing to the screen, in particular for Draw_Background, must be
--      done using this coordinate systems
--
--    - Item coordinates
--      The position of a point is relative to the top-left corner of the
--      current item. This corner therefore has coordinates (0, 0).
--      This coordinate systems assumes a zoom-level of 100%
--
--  Items are selected automatically when they are clicked. If Control is
--  pressed at the same time, multiple items can be selected.
--  If the background is clicked (and control is not pressed), then all items
--  are unselected.
--  Pressing and dragging the mouse in the backgroudn draws a virtual box on
--  the screen. All the items fully included in this box when it is released
--  will be selected (this will replace the current selection if Control was
--  not pressed).

   -------------------
   -- Drawing links --
   -------------------
   --  Drawing of links can be controlled at several levels:
   --    - Redefining Update_Links gives control at the canvas level. This can
   --      be used to implement routing algorithms for the links where the
   --      routes must be computed before any link is actually drawn (otherwise
   --      it is better to redefine Draw_Link). It can also be used to control
   --      in what order the links should be drawn.
   --    - Redefining Draw_Link gives the opportunity to draw links any way you
   --      need (several bends, ...). It can be used to control the routing of
   --      this specific link, for routing algorithms that only rely on the
   --      items layout and not on other links. Otherwise see Update_Links.
   --    - Redefining Draw_Straight_Line if slightly lower-level. This is
   --      called by the default Draw_Link procedure, once the ends of the
   --      links have been computed.

   procedure Update_Links
     (Canvas         : access Interactive_Canvas_Record;
      Cr             : Cairo.Cairo_Context;

   --  Redraw all the links in the canvas, after the items have been laid out.
   --

   --  selected items need to be drawn.

      Show_Annotation : Boolean := True);
   --  Redraw the link on the canvas.
   --  Note that this is a primitive procedure of Link, not of Canvas, and thus
   --  can easily be overrided for specific links. The default version draws
   --  either straight or arc links (the latter when there are multiple links
   --  between two given items).
   --  This function shouldn't be called if one of the two ends of the link is
   --  invisible.
   --
   --  Cr is the Cairo_Context that is used to draw the link.
   --  The link is drawn using the current cairo brush, so if you need to
   --  specify some particular color, you can do it directly in the
   --  Cairo_Context
   --
   --  Edge_Number indicates the index of link in the list of links that join
   --  the same source to the same destination. It should be used so that two
   --  links do not overlap (for instance, the default is to draw the first
   --  link straight, and the others as arcs).

   --  link record.
   --  This procedure is called when computing the position for the links
   --  within the default Draw_Link procedure. The default implementation only
   --  works with rectangular items. The computed coordinates are then passed
