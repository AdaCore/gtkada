   function File_Selection_Dialog
     (Title       : Glib.UTF8_String := "Select File";
      Default_Dir : String := "";
      Dir_Only    : Boolean := False;
      Must_Exist  : Boolean := False) return String;
   --  Open a file selection dialog and make it modal.
   --  Return when either the Cancel button is clicked or when a file is
   --  selected.
   --  Default_Dir is the directory to display in dialog initially. Note that
   --  it must end with a directory separator ('/' or '\', depending on your
   --  system). You can use GNAT.Os_Lib.Directory_Separator to get the correct
   --  value for your system.
   --  If Must_Exist is True, then the file (or directory if Dir_Only is True)
   --  must exist.
   --  If Dir_Only is True, then the dialog is modified so that the user can
   --  only choose a directory name, but not a file name.
   --  The value returned is the name of the file selected, or "" if none.
