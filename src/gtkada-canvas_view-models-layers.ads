   --  This algorithm is a wrapper for Glib.Graphs.Layouts.Layer_Layout.
   --
   --  It Organizes the items into layers: items in layer n never have an
   --  out-link to any item in a layer 1 .. (n - 1). Within a layer, the
   --  items are then reorganized to try and minimize the edge crossings.
   --
   --  If Add_Waypoints is True, then long edges are split with waypoints.
   --  This generally limits the number of edge crossing, but make moving
   --  items move cumbersome since the waypoints are not moved at the same
   --  time.
   --
   --  It is provided as an example, and might be changed or removed in the
   --  future.
   --
   --  When a non-null value is provided for view, the items will be animated
   --  to their new position. Otherwise, they are moved directly to the new
   --  position. Items whose current position is No_Position will not be
   --  animated, they are assumed not yet to be on the view seen by the user.
