   --  Arrays --
   -------------
   --  The following functions ease bindings: when a C function returns an
   --  array or a pointer to an array, it returns a C array, ie which doesn't
   --  contain bounds. The size of the array is generally reported separately.
   --  The following definitions are suitable for use internally in the
   --  binding, but should not, when possible, be made visble to the user,
   --  since they don't behave like usual Ada arrays ('Last is irrelevant for
   --  instance).
   --
   --  For instance, if a C function has the following profile:
   --      gint* get_sizes (GtkIconTheme* theme);  --  0 terminated array
   --  when the binding is:
   --      function Internal (Theme) return Unbounded_Gint_Array_Access;
   --  and you need to compute for yourself the number of elements, and
   --  return a Glib.Gint_Array to the user.
   --
   --  If the C function has the following profile:
   --      gboolean get_attach_points (theme, GdkPoint** p, gint* n);
   --  then the binding is:
   --      function Internal (Theme  : System.Address;
   --                         Points : out Unbounded_Points_Array_Access;
   --                         N      : access Gint) return Gboolean;
   --  and you do the following:
   --      R : aliased Unbounded_Points_Array_Access;
   --      N : aliased Gint;
   --      Tmp : constant Gboolean :=
   --         Internal (.., R'Unchecked_Access, N'Unchecked_Access);
   --      Result : Gdk_Points_Array (1 .. Natural (N)) :=
   --         To_Gint_Array (R, Natural (N));
   --      Free (R);
   --      return Result;
