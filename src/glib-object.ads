pragma Elaborate_All (Glib.GSlist);
pragma Elaborate_All (Glib.Glist);

package Glib.Object is

   type GObject_Record is tagged private;
   type GObject is access all GObject_Record'Class;
   pragma No_Strict_Aliasing (GObject);
   --  The base type for Glib/Gdk/Gtk objects. It basically gives access
   --  to an underlying C object. This is not a controlled type for
   --  efficiency reasons and because glib takes care of the memory
   --  management on its own.

   function Is_Created (Object : GObject_Record'Class) return Boolean;
   --  Return True if the associated C object has been created, False if
   --  no C object is associated with Object.
   --  This is not the same as testing whether an access type (for instance
   --  any of the widgets) is "null", since this relates to the underlying
   --  C object.

   function Get_Type (Object : access GObject_Record) return GType;
   --  Return the type of Object.
   --  This function is mostly used internally, since in Ada you can simply
   --  test whether an object belong to a class with a statement like:
   --
   --     if Object in Gtk_Button_Record'Class then ...
   --
   --  which is easier.

   ----------------
   -- Life cycle --
   ----------------

   procedure Initialize (Object : access GObject_Record'Class);
   --  Internal initialization function.
   --  See the section "Creating your own widgets" in the documentation.

   procedure Ref (Object : access GObject_Record);
   --  Increment the reference counter for Object. See Unref below.
   --  Since an object is not deleted while its reference count is not null,
   --  this is a way to keep an object in memory, in particular when you
   --  want to temporarily remove a widget from its parent.

   procedure Unref (Object : access GObject_Record);
   --  Decrement the reference counter for Object. When this reaches 0, the
   --  object is effectively destroy, all the callbacks associated with it are
   --  disconnected.

   type Weak_Notify is access procedure
     (Data                 : System.Address;
      Where_The_Object_Was : System.Address);
   pragma Convention (C, Weak_Notify);
   --  Called when Where_The_Object_Was is destroyed (although you can still
   --  use this to reset it). Data is the argument passed to Weak_Ref.
   --  You should destroy and free the memory occupied by Data

   procedure Weak_Ref
     (Object : access GObject_Record'Class;
      Notify : Weak_Notify;
      Data   : System.Address := System.Null_Address);
   --  This kind of reference doesn't increment the object's reference
   --  counting. However, it can and should be used to monitor the object's
   --  life cycle, in particular to detect is destruction.
   --  When Object is destroyed, calls Notify

   procedure Weak_Unref
     (Object : access GObject_Record'Class;
      Notify : Weak_Notify;
      Data   : System.Address := System.Null_Address);
   --  Cancels the settings of Weak_Ref.

   procedure Deallocate (Object : access GObject_Record);
   --  This operation is used to deallocate Object.
   --  The default implementation assumes that the value passed in is an
   --  access value created by an allocator of the default pool, i.e. it
   --  will assume that an instance of
   --  Unchecked_Deallocation (GObject_Record'Class, GObject)
   --  can be used to deallocate the designated object.
   --  Types derived of GObject_Record can override this operation in order
   --  to cope with objects allocated on other pools or even objects allocated
   --  on the stack.
   --  This design is limited to support only one allocation strategy for each
   --  class, as the class tag is used to identify the applicable strategy.

   procedure Ref_Sink (Object : access GObject_Record);
   --  Increase the reference count of Object, and possibly remove the
   --  floating reference, if Object has a floating reference.
   --  In other words, if the object is floating, then this call "assumes
   --  ownership" of the floating reference, converting it to a normal
   --  reference by clearing the floating flag while leaving the reference
   --  count unchanged.  If the object is not floating, then this call
   --  adds a new normal reference increasing the reference count by one.

   ------------------------
   -- Interfacing with C --
   ------------------------
   --  The following functions are made public so that one can easily create
   --  new objects outside the Glib or Gtk package hierarchy.
   --  Only experienced users should make use of these functions.

   function Get_Object
     (Object : access GObject_Record'Class) return System.Address;
   --  Access the underlying C pointer.

   function Get_Object_Or_Null (Object : GObject) return System.Address;
   --  Same as above, but passing "null" is valid.

   procedure Set_Object
     (Object : access GObject_Record'Class;
      Value  : System.Address);
   --  Modify the underlying C pointer.

   function Get_User_Data
     (Obj  : System.Address;
      Stub : GObject_Record'Class) return GObject;
   --  Return the Ada object matching the C object Obj. If Obj was created
   --  explicitely from GtkAda, this will be the exact same widget. If Obj was
   --  created implicitely by gtk+ (buttons in complex windows,...), a new Ada
   --  object of type Stub will be created.

   function Get_User_Data_Or_Null (Obj : System.Address) return GObject;
   --  Return the Ada object matching the Obj, if Obj was created explicitly
   --  from Ada, or null otherwise.

   function Get_User_Data_Fast
     (Obj  : System.Address;
      Stub : GObject_Record'Class) return GObject;
   --  Same as Get_User_Data, but does not try to guess the type of Obj,
   --  always default to Stub if Obj is unknown to GtkAda.

   function Unchecked_Cast
     (Obj  : access GObject_Record'Class;
      Stub : GObject_Record'Class) return GObject;
   --  Cast Obj in an object of tag Stub'Class.
   --  Return the resulting object and free the memory pointed by Obj.

   -------------
   -- Signals --
   -------------
   --  Any child of GObject can be associated with any number of signals. The
   --  mechanism for signals is fully generic, and any number of arguments can
   --  be associated with signals.
   --  See the function Initialize_Class_Record for more information on how
   --  to create new signals for your own new widgets.
   --  The subprograms below are provided for introspection: they make it
   --  possible to query the list of signals defined for a specific widget,
   --  as well as their parameters and return types.

   type Signal_Id_Array is array (Guint range <>) of Glib.Signal_Id;

   type Signal_Query is private;

   function Lookup
     (Object : Glib.GType; Signal : Signal_Name) return Glib.Signal_Id;
   --  Returns the signal Id associated with a specific Object/Signal pair.
   --  Null_Signal_Id is returned if no such signal exists for Object.
   --  You can then use the Query procedure to get more information on the
   --  signal.

   function List_Ids (Typ : Glib.GType) return Signal_Id_Array;
   --  Return the list of signals defined for Typ. You can get more information
   --  on each of this signals by using the Query function below.
   --  See also the function Get_Type above to convert from an object instance
   --  to its type. Using a GType as the parameter makes it easier to find the
   --  signals for a widget and its ancestors (using Glib.Parent).

   procedure Query (Id : Glib.Signal_Id; Result : out Signal_Query);
   --  Return the description associated with the signal Id. You can get the
   --  various fields from Query with one of the functions below.
   --  Result is undefined if Id is Invalid_Signal_Id or Null_Signal_Id

   function Id (Q : Signal_Query) return Glib.Signal_Id;
   --  Return the signal Id. Each Id is specific to a widget/signal name pair.
   --  These Ids can then be used to temporarily block a signal for instance,
   --  through the subprograms in Gtk.Handlers.

   function Signal_Name (Q : Signal_Query) return Glib.Signal_Name;
   --  Return the name of the signal, as should be used in a call to Connect.

   function Return_Type (Q : Signal_Query) return Glib.GType;
   --  Return the type of object returned by the handlers for this signal.

   function Params (Q : Signal_Query) return GType_Array;
   --  Return the list of parameters for the handlers for this signal

   --------------------------
   -- Creating new widgets --
   --------------------------
   --  These types and functions are used only when creating new widget types
   --  directly in Ada. These functions initialize the classes so that they are
   --  correctly recognized by gtk+ itself
   --  See the GtkAda user's guide for more information on how to create your
   --  own widget types in Ada.

   type Interface_Vtable is private;
   --  The virtual table of an interface (see Glib.Types). This is only useful
   --  when doing introspection.

   type GObject_Class is new GType_Class;
   Null_GObject_Class : constant GObject_Class;
   --  This type encloses all the informations related to a specific type of
   --  object or widget. All instances of such an object have a pointer to this
   --  structure, that includes the definition of all the signals that exist
   --  for a given object, all its properties,...
   --
   --  A GObject_Class can be retrieved from a GType by calling
   --  Glib.Types.Class_Ref. This will however initialize the class record, so
   --  is too late to add interfaces or properties to the class afterwards.

   type Ada_GObject_Class_Record;
   type Ada_GObject_Class is access all Ada_GObject_Class_Record;
   pragma Convention (C, Ada_GObject_Class);
   Uninitialized_Class : constant Ada_GObject_Class;
   --  This type plays a role similar to GObject_Class, but encapsulates
   --  information needed on the Ada side to implement proxies to Ada code
   --  (since we need to convert from C type to Ada types).
   --  This structure should be treated as opaque.

   type Ada_Class_Init is access procedure (Self : GObject_Class);
   pragma Convention (C, Ada_Class_Init);
   --  Called the first time the class is initialized.
   --  This procedure is meant to add new properties to the class, or
   --  override the default handlers.

   type Ada_GObject_Class_Record is record
      The_Type     : GType := 0;

      Class_Init      : Ada_Class_Init := null;
      Property_Setter : System.Address := System.Null_Address;
      Property_Getter : System.Address := System.Null_Address;
      --  Do not call this function directly (or set it directly, these are
      --  set through various other subprograms).
   end record;

   type Signal_Parameter_Types is
     array (Natural range <>, Natural range <>) of GType;
   --  The description of the parameters for each event. These are the
   --  parameters that the application must provide when emitting the
   --  signal. The user can of course add his own parameters when connecting
   --  the signal in his application, through the use of
   --  Gtk.Handlers.User_Callback.
   --
   --  Each event defined with Initialize_Class_Record below should have an
   --  entry in this table. If Gtk_Type_None is found in the table, it is
   --  ignored. For instance, a Signal_Parameter_Type like:
   --    (1 => (1 => Gdk_Type_Gdk_Event, 2 => GType_None),
   --     2 => (1 => GType_Int,          2 => GType_Int));
   --  defines two signals, the first with a single Gdk_Event parameter, the
   --  second with two ints parameters.

   type Signal_Return_Types is array (Natural range <>) of GType;
   No_Return_Types : constant Signal_Return_Types := (1 .. 0 => GType_None);
   --  The expected return types for signal callbacks.
   --  In general, callbacks are not expected to return any value. One special
   --  case is callbacks returning a boolean (GType_Boolean). In such a case,
   --  GtkAda assumes the return value is used to stop signal propagation when
   --  it is true (indicating the signal has been handled).

   No_Signals : constant Gtkada.Types.Chars_Ptr_Array :=
      (1 .. 0 => Gtkada.Types.Null_Ptr);
   Null_Parameter_Types : constant Signal_Parameter_Types (1 .. 0, 1 .. 0) :=
     (others => (others => GType_None));
   --  An empty array, used as a default parameter in Initialize_Class_Record.

   procedure Initialize_Class_Record
     (Ancestor     : GType;

      Parameters   : Signal_Parameter_Types := Null_Parameter_Types;
      Returns      : Signal_Return_Types := No_Return_Types;
      Class_Init   : Ada_Class_Init := null);
   function Initialize_Class_Record
     (Ancestor     : GType;
      Class_Record : not null access Ada_GObject_Class;
      Type_Name    : String;
      Signals      : Gtkada.Types.Chars_Ptr_Array := No_Signals;
      Parameters   : Signal_Parameter_Types := Null_Parameter_Types;
      Returns      : Signal_Return_Types := No_Return_Types;
      Class_Init   : Ada_Class_Init := null)
   return Boolean;
   --  Create the class record for a new object type.
   --  It is associated with Signals new signals. A pointer to the
   --  newly created structure is also returned in Class_Record.
   --  If Class_Record /= Uninitialized_Class, no memory allocation is
   --  performed, we just reuse it. As a result, each instantiation of an
   --  object will share the same GObject_Class, exactly as is done for gtk+.
   --
   --  As a special case, if Parameters has its default value, all signals are
   --  created with no argument. This is done for backward compatibility
   --  mainly, and you should instead give it an explicit value.
   --  Type_Name should be a unique name identifying the name of the new type.
   --
   --  Only the signals with no parameter can be connected from C code.
   --  However, any signal can be connected from Ada. This is due to the way
   --  we define default marshallers for the signals.
   --
   --  The function returns True if the class record was just created (i.e.
   --  only the first time). This can be used to do further initialization
   --  at that point, like adding interfaces that the type implement. It used
   --  to be where one would override the default signal handlers for draw,
   --  for instance, but this now needs to be done in the Class_Init
   --  callback (see below).
   --
   --  The function Class_Init can be used to add custom properties
   --  to the class, or override default signal handlers. Such settings need
   --  to be done in a separate callback (as opposed to in the function that
   --  calls Initialize_Class_Record) because they need access to the gtk+
   --  class record, which is only created when it is actually needed.

   function Type_From_Class (Class_Record : GObject_Class) return GType;
   --  Return the internal gtk+ type that describes the newly created
   --  Class_Record.
   --  See the function Glib.Types.Class_Peek for the opposite function
   --  converting from a GType to a GObject_Class.

   procedure G_New
      (Object : not null access GObject_Record'Class;
       Typ    : Ada_GObject_Class);
   --  Create a new instance of Typ (at the C level). This has no effect if
   --  the C object has already been created (so that G_New can be called
   --  from Initialize (and you can call the parent's Initialize).
   --
   --  See a variant in Glib.Values that allow you to set properties at

   --  Binding_Sync_Create: synchronizes the values of the source and target
