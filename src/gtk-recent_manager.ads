--  <description>
--  Gtk_Recent_Manager provides a facility for adding, removing and looking up
--  recently used files. Each recently used file is identified by its URI, and
--  has meta-data associated to it, like the names and command lines of the
--  applications that have registered it, the number of time each application
--  has registered the same file, the mime type of the file and whether the
--  file should be displayed only by the applications that have registered it.
--
--  The Gtk_Recent_Manager acts like a database of all the recently used files.
--  You can create new Gtk_Recent_Manager objects, but it is more efficient to
--  use the standard recent manager for the Gdk_Screen so that information
--  about recently used files is shared with other people using them. In case
--  the default screen is being used, adding a new recently used file is
--  as simple as:
--
--     declare
--        Manager : constant Gtk_Recent_Manager := Get_Default;
--     begin
--        Add_Item (Manager, File_URI);
--     end;
--
--  While looking up a recently used file is as simple as using:
--
--     declare
--        Manager : constant Gtk_Recent_Manager := Get_Default;
--        Info    : Gtk_Recent_Info;
--        Error   : Glib.Error.GError;
--     begin
--        Lookup_Item (Info, Manager, File_URI, Error);
--        if Error /= null then
--           --  Use the info object
--           Unref (Info);
--        else
--           Put_Line
--             ("Could not find the file: " & Glib.Error.Get_Message (Error));
--           Glib.Error.Error_Free (Error);
--        end if;
--     end;
--
--  Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.
