--  <description>
--  The type Gtk_Tree_Model defined in this model defines an abstract interface
--  to represent sets of data that will be displayed in a Gtk_Tree_View.
--  Various default implementations are provided  in the Gtk.Tree_Store and
--  Gtk.List_Store packages.
--
--  Data are considered as being organized into a tree-like structure.
--
--  This package also defines a number of other types to manipulate these
--  models:
--
--  A Gtk_Tree_Path is a textual pointer to a specific row/node in the
--  model. It is a column separate list of numbers, that indicate the index of
--  the child they point to.
--  For instance, "10:4:0" would points to the first (0) child of the fifth (4)
--  child of the eleventh child of the root. The depth of this path is 3.
--
--  A Gtk_Tree_Iter is similar to a path, but is a direct pointer to the actual
--  data. It is also more efficient to use than paths.
--
--  A Gtk_Row_Reference is an object that tracks model changes, so that it
--  always refere to the same row. A Gtk_Tree_Path refers to a position in the
--  model, not a fixed row.
