--  <description>
--  This package is a rewrite of Gtkada.Canvas, with hopefully more
--  capabilities and a cleaner API.
--
--  It provides a drawing area (canvas) on which items can be displayed and
--  linked together. It also supports interactive manipulation of those
--  items.
--
--  This package is organized around the concept of Model-View-Controller:
--    - The model is an item that gives access to all the items contained
--      in the canvas, although it need not necessarily own them. A default
--      model implementation is provided which indeed stores the items
--      internally, but it is possible to create a model which is a simple
--      wrapper around an application-specific API that would already have the
--      list of items.
--
--    - The view is in charge of representing the model, or a subset of it. It
--      is possible to have multiple views for a single model, each displaying
--      a different subset or a different part of the whole canvas.
--      When a view is put inside a Gtk_Scrolled_Window, it automatically
--      supports scrolling either via the scrollbars, or directly with the
--      mouse wheel or touchpad.
--
--    - The controller provides the user interaction in the canvas, and will
--      change the view and model properties when the user performs actions.
--
--  A view does not draw any background (image, grid,...). This is because
--  there are simply too many ways application want to take advantage of the
--  background. Instead, you should override the Draw_Internal primitive and
--  take advantage (optionally) of some of the helps in
--  Gtkada.Canvas_View.Views, which among other things provide ways to draw
--  grids.
--
--  Likewise, a view does not handle events by default (except for scrolling
--  when it is put in a Gtk_Scrolled_Window). This is also because applications
--  want to do widely different things (for some, clicking in the background
--  should open a menu, whereas others will want to let the user scroll by
--  dragging the mouse in the background -- likewise when clicking on items
--  for instance).
--
--  Differences with Gtkada.Canvas
--  ==============================
--
--  This package is organized around the concept of Model-View-Controller,
--  which provides a much more flexible approach. There is for instance no
--  need to duplicate the items in memory if you already have them available
--  somewhere else in your application.
--
--  Various settings that were set on an Interactive_Canvas (like the font for
--  annotations, arrow sizes,...) are now configured on each item or link
--  separately, which provides much more flexibility in what this canvas can
--  display.
--
--  The support for items is much richer: via a number of new primitive
--  operations, it is possible to control with more details the behavior of
--  items and where links should be attached to them.
--  More importantly, this package provides a ready-to-use set of predefined
--  items (rectangles, circles, text, polygons,...) which can be composited
--  and have automatic size computation. This makes it easier than before to
--  have an item that contains, for instance, a list of text fields, since
--  there is no need any more to compute the size of the text explicitly.
--
--  This package systematically use a Gdouble for coordinates (in any of the
--  coordinate systems), instead of the mix of Gint, Gdouble and Gfloat that
--  the Gtkada.Canvas is using. In fact, most of the time applications will
--  only have to deal with the item coordinate system (see below), and never
--  with the view coordinate system.
--
--  The behavior of snap-to-grid is different: whereas in Gtkada.Canvas it
--  forces items to always be aligned with the grid (with no way to have items
--  not aligned), the Canvas_View's effect is more subtle: basically, when an
--  item is moved closed enough to the grid, it will be aligned to the grid.
--  But if it is far from any grid line, you can drop it anywhere.
--  Snapping also takes into account all four edges of items, not just their
--  topleft corner.
--
--  User interaction
--  ================
--
--  By default, limited user interaction is supported:
--     * When a view is added to a Gtk_Scrolled_Window, scrolling is
--       automatically supported (it is handled by the scrolled window).
--       Users can use the mouse wheel to scroll vertically, shift and the
--       mouse wheel to scroll horizontally, or use the touchpad to navigate
--       (in general with multiple fingers).
--
--  But of course it supports much more advanced interactions, like clicking
--  on items, moving them with the mouse or keyboard,...
--
--  For this, you need to connect to the "item_event" signal, and either
--  directly handle the signal (a simple click for instance), or set some
--  data in the details parameters, to enable dragging items or the background
--  of the canvas (for scrolling). The package Gtkada.Canvas_View.Views
--  provides a number of precoded behaviors.
--
--  When dragging items, the view will scroll automatically if the mouse is
--  going outside of the visible area. Scrolling will continue while the mouse
--  stays there, even if the user does not move the mouse.
--
--  The following has not been backported yet:
--  ==========================================
--
--  Items are selected automatically when they are clicked. If Control is
--  pressed at the same time, multiple items can be selected.
--  If the background is clicked (and control is not pressed), then all items
--  are unselected.
--  Pressing and dragging the mouse in the backgroudn draws a virtual box on
--  the screen. All the items fully included in this box when it is released
--  will be selected (this will replace the current selection if Control was
--  not pressed).

   type Canvas_View_Record is new Gtk.Widget.Gtk_Widget_Record with private;
   type Canvas_View is access all Canvas_View_Record'Class;
   --  A view is a display of one particular part of the model, or a subset of
   --  it. Multiple views can be associated with a specific model, and will
   --  monitor changes to it view signals.
   --  The view automatically refreshes its display when its model changes.

   type Canvas_Model_Record
      is abstract new Glib.Object.GObject_Record with private;
   type Canvas_Model is access all Canvas_Model_Record'Class;
   --  A model is a common interface to query the list of items that should
   --  be displayed in the canvas. It does not assume anything regarding the
   --  actual storage of the items, so it is possible to create your own
   --  model implementation that simply query the rest of your application
   --  (or a database, or some other source of data) as needed, without
   --  duplicating the items.
   --
   --  This type is not an Ada interface because it needs to inherit from

   --
   --  The interface does not provide support for adding items to the model:

   -----------------
   -- Coordinates --
   -----------------
   --  There are multiple coordinate systems used in this API. Here is a full
   --  description:
   --
   --  - Model coordinates: these are the coordinates of items without
   --    considering canvas scrolling or zooming. These do not change when the
   --    view is zoomed or scrolled, and these are therefore the coordinates
   --    that are stored in the model.
   --    The drawing of links is done within this system.
   --    These coordinates are in general oriented so that x increases towards
   --    the right, and y increases towards the bottom of the screen. This
   --    can be changed by overriding Set_Transform below.
   --
   --  - View coordinates: these are the coordinates of items in the widget
   --    representing the view. They change when the view is scrolled or
   --    zoomed. These coordinates are mostly an implementation detail.
   --
   --  - Item coordinates: these are the coordinates relative to the
   --    top-left corner of an item as if it was displayed at a zoom level of
   --    100%. All drawing of items is done with this system, so that the
   --    same item can be displayed at different positions in the view
   --    without changing the drawing instructions.
   --    The drawing coordinates are automatically converted to the view
   --    coordinates by the use of a transformation matrix, which is done very
   --    efficiently on modern systems.
   --
   --  - Window coordinates
   --    These are rarely used, only when interfacing with gtk+ events. These
   --    are the coordinates relative to the Gdk_Window of the view.

   subtype Model_Coordinate  is Gdouble;
   subtype View_Coordinate   is Gdouble;
   subtype Item_Coordinate   is Gdouble;
   subtype Window_Coordinate is Gdouble;
   --  We use subtypes for convenience in your applications to avoid casts.

   ------------------
   -- Enumerations --
   ------------------

   type Side_Attachment is (Auto, Top, Right, Bottom, Left, No_Clipping);
   --  Which side of the toplevel item the link is attached to.
   --
   --  For toplevel items, this can be controlled by using the
   --  Anchor_Attachment's X and Y properties.
   --  But for nested item, this forces the link to start from the
   --  toplevel item's border. Here is an example:
   --        +----------+
   --        | +-+      |
   --        | |A|      |\
   --        | +-+      | \1
   --        |     B    |\ \
   --        +----------+ \ \
   --                     2\ +----------------+
   --                       \|       C        |
   --                        +----------------+
   --
   --  The link 1 is attached to the nested item A, and the side_attachment
   --  is set to Right. As a result, it always starts at the same height as A
   --  itself.
   --  The link 2 is also attached to A, but the side is set to Auto. So the
   --  canvas draws the shortest path from A to C (and clips the line to the
   --  border of B). So it is not as visible that 2 is linked to A.
   --
   --  The "No_Clipping" side should be used when a link is connected to
   --  another link, since in that case there is no notion of link.

   type Anchor_Attachment is record
      X, Y          : Glib.Gdouble := 0.5;
      Toplevel_Side : Side_Attachment := Auto;
      Distance      : Model_Coordinate := 0.0;
   end record;
   Middle_Attachment : constant Anchor_Attachment := (0.5, 0.5, Auto, 0.0);
   --  Where in the item the link is attached (0.5 means the middle, 0.0
   --  means left or top, and 1.0 means right or bottom).
   --
   --  For the target side of a link, if X or Y are negative, Gtkada will try
   --  to draw a strictly orthogonal or vertical segment next on that end by
   --  adjusting the location of the end point along the border of the item. If
   --  it cannot, then GtkAda will use the absolute value of X and Y to specify
   --  the attachment.
   --
   --  You can therefore force a link to always emerge from the right side of
   --  an item by setting X to 1.0 and Y to any value, for instance.
   --  See the description of Side_Attachment for an example on how to use
   --  Toplevel_Side.
   --  Distance indicates at which distance from the border of the item the
   --  link should stop. By default, it reaches the border.

   type Route_Style is (Orthogonal, Straight, Arc, Curve);
   --  This defines how a link is routed between its two ends.
   --  Curve is similar to orthogonal (links restricted to horizontal and
   --  vertical lines), but using a bezier curve.

   ------------------
   -- Draw context --
   ------------------

   type Draw_Context is record
      Cr     : Cairo.Cairo_Context := Cairo.Null_Context;
      Layout : Pango.Layout.Pango_Layout := null;
      View   : Canvas_View := null;
   end record;
   --  Context to perform the actual drawing

   --------------------
   -- Abstract Items --
   --------------------

   type Abstract_Item_Record is interface;
   type Abstract_Item is access all Abstract_Item_Record'Class;
   --  These are all the elements that can be displayed on a canvas, including
   --  the boxes, the links between the boxes, any annotations on those links,
   --  and so on.
   --  Items can be grouped, so that toplevel items contain one or more
   --  other items. The toplevel items are the ones that are moved
   --  interactively by the user, and their contained items will be moved
   --  along.
   --  All primitive operations on items, except its position, are done in the
   --  Item's own coordinate systems so that it is easy to create new types of
   --  items without paying attention to any of its parents rotation or
   --  scaling, or the rotation and scaling of the view itself).
   --
   --  This interface is meant for use when you already have ways to store
   --  coordinates and sizes in your own data types, at which point you can
   --  implement a simpler wrapper for your data type that implements this
   --  interface. In general, though, it is better to extend the type
   --  Abstract_Item_Record which provides its own non-abstract handling for a
   --  number of subprograms below.

   --    selection,...

   --    the canvas has the focus. It can be used to move items with the arrow

   --  * Scroll is used when the user uses the mouse wheel. It is not possible
