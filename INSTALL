Installing and compiling your programs
======================================

If you have a previous version of GtkAda on your system, we recommend that
you move/remove it using e.g. the following command:

   $ mv <prefix>/include/gtkada <prefix/include/gtkada.old

where <prefix> is the prefix you used to configure GtkAda the first time.
The default prefix is /usr/local. If you don't have the rights to move
these files, then you should at least make sure that your ADA_INCLUDE_PATH
and your ADA_OBJECTS_PATH don't include this directory before building GtkAda.

To install GtkAda, you will first need to install GNAT in order to compile
it.

On Unix systems, you'll then just need to run the following command once
GNAT is installed and available in your PATH:

   $ sudo env "PATH=$PATH" ./doinstall

On Windows, just run the Gtkada installer and follow the displayed instructions.

Note that you might have to be root to install GtkAda on your system.

On Unix systems, you'll need to run the <prefix>/bin/gtkada-env.sh script
to setup your environment for Gtkada.

Then, to compile your application, simply add on top of your project file:

   with "gtkada";

And compile with GPRbuild.
