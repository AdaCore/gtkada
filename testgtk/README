This is the GtkAda version of the C testgtk program, demonstrating the
use of most of the GtkAda widgets. Many improvements have been made compared
to the original C implementation.

This is both a test program, a source of examples, and a nice demo of the
GtkAda technology.

To build it under unix, simply type make after having configured GtkAda.

To build it under windows, use the following command:

gnatmake -I../lib -Iopengl -Ipixbuf testgtk -largs -llw -lopengl32 -lglu32
