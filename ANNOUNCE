GtkAda 0.6 release (Beta code)
------------------------------

GtkAda is an Ada95 binding of Gtk+ version 1.2.0. It allows you to
develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

Currently, all widgets  of the Gtk+ 1.2 series have  been bound. The
binding  for the Gdk part is not complete yet,  but is already pretty
much in place.

To test our binding, the testgtk program have been almost completely 
re-implemented and is also distributed with the binding.
