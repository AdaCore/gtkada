GtkAda 2.0.0 release
--------------------

GtkAda is an Ada95 graphical toolkit based on Gtk+ version >= 2.0.0. It
allows you to develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

The primary download site is http://libre.act-europe.fr/GtkAda

This version represents a major update to the Gtk+ 2.0.0 API.
Most of the new features of Gtk+ 2.0.0 have been bound at this stage.
Most of the GtkExtra package has not been ported to Gtk+ 2.0.0 yet (this
is work in progress), so these widgets are currently disabled.

GtkAda 2.0.0 also comes with two new widgets which are not fully stabilized
yet, and on which feedbacks and comments will be welcome:
- GtkAda.File_Selector:  a new file selector widget
- GtkAda.MDI:            a fully featured multiple document interface suitable
                         for use in IDE-like applications.
