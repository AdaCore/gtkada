GtkAda 1.2.6 release
--------------------

GtkAda is an Ada95 graphical toolkit based on Gtk+ version >= 1.2.2. It
allows you to develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

Currently, all widgets  of the Gtk+ 1.2 series have  been bound. The
binding  for the Gdk part is not complete yet, but is already pretty
much in place.

To test our toolkit, the testgtk program has been almost completely 
re-implemented and is also distributed.

New features in 1.2.6 include:

New features in 1.2.5 include:

- Extensive documentation update. GtkAda now comes with both a User's Guide
  and a Reference Manual.
- New scheme for callbacks. This is much more complete than the old scheme,
  and will permit for instance the creation of callbacks that return a
  value (such as for the signal "delete_event"). It is also much more
  systematic than the old one (less packages need to be instantiated).
- Gate has been updated to Glade 0.5.5, plus various bug fixes
- Complete Gtk+ support for Gate/Dgate
- A new example shows how to do some flicker-free animation with GtkAda
- Tested on HP-UX 11.00
- Tested on SCO UnixWare 7.1
