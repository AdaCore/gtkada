--------------------

GtkAda is an Ada95 graphical toolkit based on Gtk+. It allows you
to develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

This version repsents a minor update compared to GtkAda 2.0.0, and is
suitable for use with Gtk+ 2.0.0 and above.
Note that most of the GtkExtra package has not been ported to Gtk+ 2.0 yet
(this is work in progress), so these widgets are currently disabled.
