GtkAda 1.2.5 release
--------------------

GtkAda is an Ada95 graphical toolkit based on Gtk+ version >= 1.2.2. It
allows you to develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

Currently, all widgets  of the Gtk+ 1.2 series have  been bound. The
binding  for the Gdk part is not complete yet, but is already pretty
much in place.

To test our toolkit, the testgtk program has been almost completely 
re-implemented and is also distributed.

New features in 1.2.5 include:

- New scheme for callbacks. This is much more complete than the old scheme,
  and will permit for instance the creation of callbacks that return a
  value (such as for the signal "delete_event"). It is also much more
  systematic than the old one (less packages need to be instantiated).
- Gate has been updated to Glade 0.5.5, plus various bug fixes
- A new example shows how to do some flicker-free animation with GtkAda
- Tested on HP-UX 11.00
- Tested on SCO UnixWare 7.1
- Complete Gtk+ support for Gate/Dgate

New features in 1.2.4 include:

- GtkAda now supports OpenGL. A binding to GtkglArea is provided, see e.g
  testgtk which has been updated to give some examples of OpenGL.
  You do *not* need OpenGL to build GtkAda, this is an optional part of the
  toolkit
  A very thin binding to the OpenGL library MESA is also provided, although
  you are invited to use your own OpenGL binding rather than this one.
- Handling of Gdk events has been rewritten, so that:
    * It is now much easier to convert from one event type to another
    * It is possible to create events directly from GtkAda, and then send them
      to any widget.
- Handling of signals has been modified, so that GtkAda now tests that the
  handler provided are compatible argument-wise with what is expected in gtk+.
  The same test is done when emitting a signal.
- New code generation in Gate:
    * take advantage of the composite types
    * generate a child package for callbacks related to each composite widget
    * generate comments in callback stubs to separate cleanly each callback,
      and to avoid occasional merge failures
- Tested on AiX 4.3.2
- New widgets supported by Gate/Dgate: Gtk_List, Gtk_Clist (partially),
  Gtk_Paned, Gtk_Viewport, Gtk_Vscrollbar
- Fixed Gate support for Gtk_Frame (Label handling)
- Simple minded support for XML attributes in Glib.XML

New features in 1.2.3 include:

- Minor bug fixes in Gate code generation
- Cosmetic fixes
- Screen_Width_MM & Screen_Height_MM are now bound in Gdk.Main
- New widgets supported by Gate/Dgate: Gtk_Button_*Box, Gtk_Entry

New features in 1.2.2 include:

- Gate/Dgate now generate a warning when encountering an unsupported widget
- Most widgets and properties are now supported by Gate/Dgate (see the
  documentation for a list of unsupported widgets)
- Minor bug fixes
- Tested on Solaris/x86
- Ported to Win32

New features in 1.2.1 include:

- The docs/ directory now contains a set of slides describing GtkAda
- Installation problems reported with 1.2.0 have been fixed
- Gdk.RGB has been bound
- Updated features in Gtk.Style and Gtk.Table
- The editor example has been completed
- GtkAda is now capable of fully converting any C widget to the correct Ada
  widget, even if the C widget was not created by GtkAda itself. This
  provides a full dynamic dispatching capability that was still missing.
  (see gtk-type_conversion.ads for more information)
- Tested on HP/UX

New features in 1.2.0 include:

- All 1.2.0 widgets are now bound (including Gtk.Ctree)
- New directory structure
- First version of the documentation
- Code generation simplified in Gate
- New widgets supported by Gate/Dgate
- Support for Accelerators in widgets
- New examples in the example/ directory: how to create a widget directly
  in Ada (both composite widgets and widgets from scratch); a simple editor
  generated using Glade.
