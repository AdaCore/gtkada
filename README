General Information

This home page will always contain the latest news for this toolkit.

This is GtkAda version 2.4.1. This package is an Ada95 graphical library
for the Gimp Toolkit, which means this is a set of packages to allow you
to easily create some graphical interfaces under X11 and Win32, using Ada95
as a programming language.

Every widget from gtk 2.2 has been bound, and the test
program found in the gtk release has been reimplemented in Ada (have a
look at the testgtk/ directory).
     
These functions were tested on the following systems:
   - Linux/x86
   - Solaris/sparc
   - Windows NT/2000/XP
   - IRIX
   - HP-UX
   - Tru64

using the following compilers:
   - GNAT 5.02
   - GCC 3.4.2

the following versions of gtk:
   - Gtk+ 2.4.13

If you manage to use it on other systems (which should probably be
straightforward - just recompile GtkAda), please let us know so that
we can add to the above list.
