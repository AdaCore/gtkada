General Information

This home page will always contain the latest news for this toolkit.

This is GtkAda version 2.8.1. This package is an Ada95 graphical library
for the Gimp Toolkit, which means this is a set of packages to allow you
to easily create some graphical interfaces under X11 and Win32, using Ada
as the programming language.

This library has been tested using Gtk+ 2.8.17 on the following systems:

   - GNU Linux/x86
   - GNU Linux/x86-64
   - GNU Linux/ia64
   - Solaris/sparc
   - Solaris/x86
   - Windows XP
   - AIX
   - IRIX
   - HP-UX/pa
   - HP-UX/ia64
   - Tru64
   - Mac OS X
   - FreeBSD/x86

If you manage to use it on other systems (which should probably be
straightforward - just recompile GtkAda), please let us know so that
we can add to the above list.
