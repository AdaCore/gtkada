General Information
===================
     
The home page for GtkAda is

The home page for gtk is

This home page will always contain the latest news for this toolkit.

This is GtkAda version 2.0.0. This package is an Ada95 graphical library
for the Gimp Toolkit, which means this is a set of packages to allow you
to easily create some graphical interfaces under X11 and Win32, using Ada95
as a programming language.

From now on, major version numbers will follow Gtk+ (e.g 1.2, 1.3),
meaning that stable versions of GtkAda will have major number 1.2 and
development versions will have number 1.3.

Every widget from gtk 2.0 has been implemented, and the test
program found in the gtk release has been reimplemented in Ada (have a
look at the testgtk/ directory).
     
These functions were tested on the following systems :
   - Linux/x86
   - Solaris/sparc
using the following compilers:
   - Gnat 3.15a
   - Gnat 3.14p

the following versions of gtk:
   - Gtk+ 2.0.0

If you manage to use it on other systems (which should probably be
straightforward - just recompile GtkAda), please let us know so that
we can add to the above list.
