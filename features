JA07-018 Bindings to GTK+ printing API

  In addition to bindings already added as part of J510-028, additional
  packages have been provided so that full use of the printing API provided
  by GTK+ is possible.  The existing printing example in testgtk has been
  enhanced to demonstrate how to use the new API.
