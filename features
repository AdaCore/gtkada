GTKADA NEW FEATURES LIST
========================

Copyright (c) 2010-2011, AdaCore

This file contains a list of new features introduced in GtkAda.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the
description line. This date shows the implementation date
of the feature.

New features in GtkAda 3.8.2
----------------------------

M723-015 New bindings and Gtk Application enhancement (2013-07-23)

  New bindings for GApplicationCommandLine, in Glib.Application.
  New bindings for GOptionContext, GOptionGroup and GOptionEntry, in
    Glib.Option.
  New package GtkAda.Application, to support opening files from OS-specific
    inter-process calls (DDE on Windows, System events on OSX).

New features in GtkAda 3.4.1
----------------------------

L726-002 New On_* procedures to ease signal connection (2012-12-20)

  Each widget has a number of additional primitives to ease signal
  connection. For instance, one can use
      Button.On_Clicked (Handler'Access);
  now. See the user's guide for more information.

LB30-013 New subprogram Gtk.Handlers.Set_On_Exception (2012-11-30)

  It was always recommended that Ada callbacks should not propagate
  exceptions to the C gtk+ layer. To enforce this, GtkAda now has its
  own internal exception handlers. But it is possible for applications
  to register a subprogram to call when a callback has raised an
  exception, presumably to log the exception in an application-specific
  manner (the default is to output the exception on stderr).

  These handlers are set automatically on signal and event callbacks,
  and on idle and timeout callbacks.

LB20-008 Gtk_New_* as functions (2012-12-17)

  GtkAda now includes a function for each version of Gtk_New*_, which
  might be simpler to use in some contexts. In particular, local variables
  can now be initialized directly in their declarations.

L413-025 Binding for Gtk.Recent_Chooser_Menu

  A new binding for Gtk.Recent_Chooser_Menu has been added.  This
  widget shows a list of recently used resources in menu form.

L125-027 Remove support for GNOME widgets (2012-01-25)

  These widgets were no longer support nor up-to-date with regards to
  the GNOME libraries themselves, so were removed.

New features in GtkAda 2.24.1
-----------------------------

KC08-027 Documentation converted to Sphinx (2011-12-08)

  The new format provides nicer output, as well as an integrated search
  facility for the HTML version

New features in GtkAda 2.22.0
-----------------------------

K506-019 Binding for GtkSpinner

  A new binding Gtk.Spinner has been added.  A Gtk.Spinner is an animated
  widget that can be used to signal the user that some program activity is
  occurring.

K422-015 Design changes and preparation for Gtk-3

  Gtkada.MDI has been slightly changed so that MDI children now have nicer
  looking menubars. MDI notebooks now contain a close button that allows
  the user to close tabs that are not in front.

  The Gtkada.Canvas widget has been completely redesigned to make use of
  Cairo instead of Gdk. Its API should now be Gtk-3 ready.

  Added new Cairo bindings: Cairo.PDF, Cairo.Region, Cairo.SVG. Gdk.Window has
  also been completed with Cairo bindings.

  New package Gtkada.Style to provide Gtk.Style-like drawing primitives that
  use Cairo instead of Gdk.

K125-039 Glade-3 GUI builder

  The GUI builder shipped with GtkAda has been upgraded to Glade-3.

JC10-012 MDI: short titles also applies to title bars

  The MDI can be configured so that floating windows use a short title
  rather than a full title (in particular, for file names, this will generally
  be the base name rather than full path name). This preference now also
  applies to title bars for non-floating windows.

JB29-030 MDI: support for independent perspectives

  It is now possible to configure the MDI so that the perspectives do not
  share the central area (as a result, no window is preserved when switching
  among perspectives, unless they are explicitly part of the new perspective).

JB09-025 High-level API for using Glade-3 and Gtk.Builder

  A new package Gtkada.Builder has been introduced. This provides a
  high-level API for developing GtkAda applications using the Glade-3
  GUI builder.

JA07-018 Bindings to GTK+ printing API

  In addition to bindings already added as part of J510-028, additional
  packages have been provided so that full use of the printing API provided
  by GTK+ is possible.  The existing printing example in testgtk has been
  enhanced to demonstrate how to use the new API.
