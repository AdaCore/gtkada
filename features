description line. This date shows the implementation date
of the feature.

New features in GtkAda 2.18.0
-----------------------------

J609-002 New signal GtkAda.MDI.Signal_Child_State_Changed

  This signal can be used to monitor state changes for windows. In
  particular, it allows tracking when a window is removed from the
  perspective when the user switches perspectives

J528-030 GtkAda.MDI gives focus after a short delay to floating windows

  When moving over a floating window, the MDI will now only give it the
  focus after a short delay. This is more user friendly especially in the
  case of all-floating mode: while going from one window to the menu bar,
  for instance, the mouse goes over existing windows, and would change
  the focus window without this delay, making it impractical to use the
  menu bar in this mode.

J528-025 Support for OpenGL/Gtk.GLArea under Windows

  It is now possible to integrate OpenGL in GtkAda applications under
  Windows, using the GLArea widget.

J511-036 GtkAda.MDI.Set_Dnd_Message

  It is now possible to configure the text in the tooltip while dragging
  windows. The default text mentions editors, which is not appropriate in
  all contexts.
