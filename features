New features in GtkAda 2.22.0
-----------------------------

JC10-012 MDI: short titles also applies to title bars

  The MDI can be configured so that floating windows use a short title
  rather than a full title (in particular, for file names, this will generally
  be the base name rather than full path name). This preference now also
  applies to title bars for non-floating windows.

JB09-025 High-level API for using Glade-3 and Gtk.Builder

  A new package Gtkada.Builder has been introduced. This provides a
  high-level API for developing GtkAda applications using the Glade-3
  GUI builder.

JA07-018 Bindings to GTK+ printing API

  In addition to bindings already added as part of J510-028, additional
  packages have been provided so that full use of the printing API provided
  by GTK+ is possible.  The existing printing example in testgtk has been
  enhanced to demonstrate how to use the new API.
