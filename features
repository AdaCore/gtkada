  the Gtk+. This change introduce incompatibility in the profile of the
  Gtk_Clipboard_Image_Received_Func callback subprogram: the Pixbuf parameter

New features in GtkAda 2.12.0
-----------------------------

H903-015 Gtk.Extra.Combo_Button.Get_Arrow no longer exists

  This was replaced by Get_Toggle_Button to match what is returned by the
  C code. We no longer have access to the arrow itself, so Get_Arrow could
  not be preserved. Instead of sending the "clicked" signal to the arrow
  to force the display of the popup window, you should call Set_Active on
  the button returned by Get_Toggle_Button.

  The function Gdk.Keyval.To_Unicode has been bound.

H528-010 Automatic conversion of C widgets

  all standard Gtk+ widgets are now automatically converted when needed.

H121-008 Small API changes

  The following API changes have been introduced to improve safety of C/Ada
  binding.

    - in gdk-event.ads: type Event_Handler_Func now has pragma Convention (C)
      To adapt to this change, add the same pragma to your implementations for
      this function.

    - in gdk-window.ads: likewise, for type Gdk_Filter_Func.

    - in gtk-menu.ads: likewise, for type Gtk_Menu_Detacher_Func.
