GTKADA NEW FEATURES LIST
========================

Copyright (c) 2005-2008, AdaCore

This file contains a list of new features introduced in GtkAda.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the
description line. This date shows the implementation date
of the feature.

New features in GtkAda 2.12.1
-----------------------------

HB24-020 API Additions

  The package Gdk.Display_Manager has been added, allowing GtkAda
  applications to change their target X11 display.

HA17-023 Tabs position in MDI can be specific to each notebook

  Each notebook in a Gtkada_MDI can now have its own position for tabs.
  A contextual menu is provided on tabs to allow the user to change this
  interactively (and close the tab)

New features in GtkAda 2.12.0
-----------------------------

H903-015 Gtk.Extra.Combo_Button.Get_Arrow no longer exists

  This was replaced by Get_Toggle_Button to match what is returned by the
  C code. We no longer have access to the arrow itself, so Get_Arrow could
  not be preserved. Instead of sending the "clicked" signal to the arrow
  to force the display of the popup window, you should call Set_Active on
  the button returned by Get_Toggle_Button.

H620-010 Minor API additions

  The function Gdk.Keyval.To_Unicode has been bound.

H528-010 Automatic conversion of C widgets

  The package Gtk.Type_Conversion is now obsolete and now longer needed, since
  all standard Gtk+ widgets are now automatically converted when needed.

H121-008 Small API changes

  The following API changes have been introduced to improve safety of C/Ada
  binding.

    - in gdk-event.ads: type Event_Handler_Func now has pragma Convention (C)
      To adapt to this change, add the same pragma to your implementations for
      this function.

    - in gdk-window.ads: likewise, for type Gdk_Filter_Func.

    - in gtk-menu.ads: likewise, for type Gtk_Menu_Detacher_Func.
