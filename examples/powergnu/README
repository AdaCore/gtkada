This directory contains a simple presentation viewer written using GtkAda.

It demonstrates the simplicity of use of the gdk-pixbuf library and also
is an example of a new widget (Image_Drawing) created in GtkAda that redefines
its resizing and drawing handling.

To execute: replace the contents of the file file.tst with a list of
 images (one per file), similar to

/dir/image1.jpg
/dir/image2.jpg

and execute
   ./power file.tst
