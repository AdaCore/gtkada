This is the GtkAda Examples Directory. Our goal is to provide the
GtkAda user with some pieces of code that are easy to understand, easy
to modify and to play with.

If you are interested in sharing your own programs with the GtkAda community,
please tune them with the latest GtkAda version and send them with appropriate
documentation (and bug reports) to the authors.

Note that you need to first install GtkAda to use these examples.

Some of the examples are build using the GNAT project files, to demonstrate
how to use them to simply compile and link your application.
See for instance base_widget/ and calendar_combo/

Others are build using the gtkada-config script, on machines where this script
is usable.
