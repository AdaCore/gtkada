This is the GtkAda Examples Directory. Our goal is to provide the
GtkAda user with some pieces of code that are easy to understand, easy
to modify and to play with.

If you are interested in sharing your own programs with the GtkAda community,
please tune them with the latest GtkAda version and send them with appropriate
documentation (and bug reports) to the authors.

Note that you need to first install GtkAda to use these examples.

1- menu
 
  Demonstrates the use of gate/dgate with a glade project file.
  To test dgate, simply type

    $ dgate menu.glade

  And play with the interface automatically generated.

  To test gate, type

  This will generate a set of files. Optionally modify callbacks_menu.adb
  to customize it, then compile and run it:

    $ gnatmake menu `gtkada-config`
    $ menu
