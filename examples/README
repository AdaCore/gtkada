This is the GtkAda Examples Directory. Our goal is to provide the GtkAda user
some pieces of code that are easy to understand, easy to modify and to play
with.
If you are insterested in sharing your own programs with the GtkAda community,
please tune them with the latest GtkAda version and send it with appropriate
documentation (and bug reports) to the authors.

Note that you need to first install GtkAda to use these examples.
