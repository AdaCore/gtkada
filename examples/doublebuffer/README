This demo shows how you can use GtkAda to create flicker-free
animations, thanks to double-buffering.

A new widget is supplied that provides transparent double-buffering,
which you can easily reuse in your own application.

Please read the output of all the demos for more information.

How to build the demos:
  >  make


IMPORTANT NOTE:
To use the multi-tasking demo (anim), you need to compile your application
with support for native threads.
If you are using the GNAT compiler, you should read the file README.TASKING in
the GNAT distribution (basically on Linux, you need to change the links to
adalib and adainclude in the installation directories).
