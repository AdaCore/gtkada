This example demonstrates how to create your own signals in GtkAda.
Click on any of the toggle buttons in the window. When you have
clicked three of them aligned on the same row, an even is sent by
the tictactoe widget, handled by the main loop, and a text is
displayed on stdout.
Note: no image appears in the button, so as to keep the example
as simple as possible
