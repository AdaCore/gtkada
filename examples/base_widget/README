This directory contains an exemple how to create a widget directly
in Ada.

This should be reserved to users that already know how GtkAda and gtk+
work. We have tried to provide some high level interfaces (this is
much easier to do than in C, even if you still can't do
everything...), but you will have to know and to handle a lot of signals.

The widget we create here is a simple "target" widget, on which the
user can click. If the mouse was on the target, then a signal "bullseye"
(created specially for this widget) is emited, otherwise a signal
"missed" is emited.
