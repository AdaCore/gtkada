This directory contains two main examples related to the handling
of signals and marshallers in GtkAda.

- delete_event.adb

  Shows how you can connect the "delete" signal to a widget to prevent
  its closure by GtkAda.
  This signal expects handlers that return a Boolean.

- own_marshallers.ads, general_tips.adb, specific_tips.adb

  Demonstrate how you can create how you can connect to a signal that
  does not have any predefined marshaller in gtk-marshallers.

  general_tips.adb shows how to use the general form of handlers.
  specific_tips.adb shows how to create your own marshallers.

  These are not examples that you can run!!
