Known problems fixed in GtkAda 1.2.12/1.3.12

- Declaring new signals for widgets with a common parent
  Problem:    When declaring new signals (with Initialize_Class_Record) for
              two widget types that extend the same Gtk parent, the first one
              is not taken into account and the signal is not accessible.
  Workaround: Declare a first child of the Gtk parent, and make the two other
              widgets inherit from it. Declare the signals for this first
              child.
