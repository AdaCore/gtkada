Known problems fixed in GtkAda 1.2.11/1.3.11

- Declaring new signals for widgets with a common parent
  Problem:    When declaring new signals (with Initialize_Class_Record) for
              two widget types that extend the same Gtk parent, the first one
              is not taken into account and the signal is not accessible.
  Workaround: Declare a first child of the Gtk parent, and make the two other
              widgets inherit from it. Declare the signals for this first
              child.

- Option menus not shown properly when using the GUI builder
  Problem:    When creating option menus using the GUI builder, gate would
              not generate a code that would display the option menu items
              by default.
  Workaround: Modify the generated code by hand, adding explicitely calls
              to Show (The_mEnu_Item).

- Callbacks with same name not handled correctly by Gate
  Problem:    Callbacks with the same name in different top level widgets
              in the XML file were not duplicated in each callbacks package.
  Workaround: Use unique name among the project, or modify the generated code
              by hand.
