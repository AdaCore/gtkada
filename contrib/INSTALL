Installing and compiling your programs 
======================================

Since version 0.6, GtkAda comes with a configure script that should
simplify the installation. We have tested it on as many machines as
possible, please report any problem ou might have.

To install GtkAda, please try the following :
   $ ./configure --prefix=<installation_directory>
   $ make
   $ make install
     
This will create (and install) two files, libgtkada.a and libgtkada.so
and then compile the testgtk example.
     
Note that you might have to be root to install GtkAda on your system.

You should also modify your PATH variable to include the installation
directory, or copy the gtkada-config script somewhere in your path
     
   $ setenv PATH <installation_directory>:$PATH
or
   $ export PATH=<installation_directory>:$PATH
     
Finally, update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to include that
directory, so that the linker can find the libraries.  The other
alternative if you have access to root priviledges is to add this
'prefix' directory added in /etc/ld.conf and then run ldconfig.
     
Then, when you want to compile your application, simply use the
gtkada-config script:
     
   $ gnatmake <your_application> <your_switches> `gtkada-config`

This will automatically submit the correct paths to gnatmake so that
the gtk and gtkada libraries are found.
