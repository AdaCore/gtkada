Installing and compiling your programs 
======================================

If you have a previous version of GtkAda on your system, we recommend that
you remove it using the following command:

   $ rm -rf <prefix>/include/gtkada

where <prefix> is the prefix you used to configure GtkAda the first time.
The default prefix is /usr/local. If you don't have the rights to remove
these files, then you should at least make sure that your ADA_INCLUDE_PATH
and your ADA_OBJECTS_PATH don't include this directory before building GtkAda.

To install GtkAda, you first need to install glib and gtk+, then
do the following:
   $ ./configure --prefix=<installation_directory>
   $ make install

This will create (and install) the GtkAda library and then compile the
testgtk example.

IMPORTANT Note: On some systems (e.g Digital Unix), make will generate
warnings when creating the libgtkada.so shared library. You can usually
safely ignore these warnings and continue the install procedure as
described in this file.
     
Note that you might have to be root to install GtkAda on your system.

You should also modify your PATH variable to include the installation
directory, or copy the gtkada-config script somewhere in your path
     
   $ setenv PATH <installation_directory>:$PATH
or
   $ export PATH=<installation_directory>:$PATH
     
Finally, update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to include that
directory, so that the linker can find the libraries.  The other
alternative if you have access to root priviledges is to add this
'prefix' directory added in /etc/ld.conf and then run ldconfig.
     
Then, when you want to compile your application, simply use the
gtkada-config script:
     
   $ gnatmake <your_application> <your_switches> `gtkada-config`

This will automatically submit the correct paths to gnatmake so that
the gtk and gtkada libraries are found.
