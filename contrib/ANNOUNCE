GtkAda 0.4 release (Beta code)
------------------------------
     
GtkAda is  an Ada95 binding of  Gtk+ version 1.1.9.   It allows you to
develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

Currently, all widgets  of the  Gtk+ 1.1 series  have  been bound. The
binding  for the Gdk part is  not complete yet,  but is already pretty
much in place.
     
To  test our binding, the testgtk  program have been almost completely 
re-implemented and is also distributed with the binding.
