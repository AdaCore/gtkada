GtkAda 0.1 release (Alpha code)

GtkAda is an Ada95 binding of Gtk+ version 1.0.4  and 1.0.5. It allows
you to develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

Currently, all widgets  except GtkMenuFactory and  GtkAccelerator have
been  implemented. Also, the  sources of the  GtkCTree widget have not
been found either in  Gtk+ 1.0.4  and 1.0.5, and   thus have not  been
bound.

To  test our binding, the testgtk  program have been almost completely
re-implemented and is also distributed with the binding.
