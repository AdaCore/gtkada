GtkAda 1.2.6/1.3.6 release
--------------------

GtkAda is an Ada95 graphical toolkit based on Gtk+ version >= 1.2.2. It
allows you to develop graphical applications in Ada95 using Gtk+.

The primary download site is http://gtkada.eu.org

New features in 1.2.6/1.3.6 include:

- Fixed to be compatible with Gtk+ 1.2.2 instead of requiring 1.2.4
- Fixed an installation problem on some Linux versions.
- Multiple redraws under Win32 are now handled properly.
- The HTML reference manual now contains nice colored boxes.

New features in 1.2.5/1.3.5 include:

- Extensive documentation update. GtkAda now comes with both a User's Guide
  and a Reference Manual.
- New scheme for callbacks. This is much more complete than the old scheme,
  and will permit for instance the creation of callbacks that return a
  value (such as for the signal "delete_event"). It is also much more
  systematic than the old one (less packages need to be instantiated).
- Gate has been updated to Glade 0.5.5, plus various bug fixes
- Complete Gtk+ support for Gate/Dgate
- A new example shows how to do some flicker-free animation with GtkAda
- Tested on HP-UX 11.00
- Tested on SCO UnixWare 7.1
