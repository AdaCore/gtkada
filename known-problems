Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.8.2

- G112-004 Glade doesn't generate general access types
  Problem:    If you create your interface through the Glade GUI builder, the
              generate code defines an access type which isn't a general
              access type. This prevents conversions to it in various cases
  Workaround: Edit the generate file "*_pkg.ads" and add the keyword "all"

- G112-004 Glade doesn't handle signals with "Object" parameter
  Problem:    If you connect a signal to your widget through the GUI builder,
              and specify an "Object" argument to it, then the generated
              callback has an incorrect type for its parameter
  Workaround: Edit the generated code in "*_pkg-callbacks.ads"

- F206-018 GtkAda project files not working under Windows
  Problem:    The project files where not usable on Windows. The build
              options had to be passed explicitly on the command line.
  Workaround: Pass options explicitly on the command line or using a manual
              project file.

Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.8.1

- F606-001 GtkAda 2.8.0 does not run in 16bits mode under Windows
  Problem:    The libcairo-2.dll provided with GtkAda 2.8.0 does not support
              16 bits display under Windows.
  Workaround: Use 24 or 32 bits display
