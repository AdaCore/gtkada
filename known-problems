Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.4.0

- E322-003: Storage_Error raised when closing an OpenGL window
  Problem:    If you create a Gtk_GlArea and destroy its toplevel window, a
              Storage_Error is raised
  Workaround: Connect to the "destroy" event, as done in gtk-glarea.adb

- Memory leak in Gtk.Tree_Model.Get_String (D823-006)
  Problem:    Calling Gtk.Tree_Model.Get_String causes a memory leak.
  Workaround: There is no known workaround.

Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.2.1

- Gate has no support for including images in menu items (C929-003)
  Problem:    If you create menu items that contain images, the latter are not
              correctly shown unless they come from the stock icons provided by
              gtk+ itself
  Workaround: Add your own calls to Gtk.Image_Menu_Item.Set_Image to add images
              manually

- Shadow Type not taken into account for scrolled windows in Gate (C929-003)
  Problem:    Specifying a shadow type in glade for scrolled window has no
              result on the Ada code generated by Code
  Workaround: Add a call to Set_Shadow_Type in the code

- Wrong code generated by gate for combo boxes (C923-002)
  Problem:    If a combo box is added to the GUI, a Storage_Error will happen
              when the application is started
  Workaround: Remove the lines creating the internal widgets from the generated
              sources

- Incorrect handling of GtkTextBuffer signals (C923-002)
  Problem:    If a "changed" signal is set on a GtkTextView, it really should
              be connected to the buffer instead.
  Workaround: Add a call to Get_Buffer in the call to Connet, and make sure
              the callback expected a Gtk_Text_Buffer instead of a
              GtkTextView

- Wrong code generated by gate for progress bars
  Problem:    When creating with glade a progress bar with a fraction of 0.0,
              the code generated contains '0' which does not compile.
  Workaround: Specify 0.01 instead, or edit the generated code.
