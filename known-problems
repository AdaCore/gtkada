Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.18.0

- JA07-011 GtkAda.MDI.Raise_Child and floating windows
  Problem:    When a window is floating and Raise_Child is called, the
              window is not systematically made visible if you ask not
              to give the focus.
  Workaround: see Give_Focus to True when calling Raise_Child

- J813-008 Wrong binding for Pango.Font.Get_Style, Pango.Font.Set_Style
  Problem:    Calling these subprograms does not have the expected behavior
              and may cause instability.
  Workaround: Fix the bindings from pango_font_description_(get|set)_size
              to pango_font_description_(get|set)_style.

- J702-017 Crash in MDI when loading desktop
  Problem:    If the desktop restored by calling Restore_Desktop contains
              a notebook with no raised child (ie a <child> node with
              an attribute Raised="True"), then an error (fatal on Windows
              systems) would occur later on.
  Workaround: Upon a crash, the simplest is to destroy the perspectives.xml
              file, although this will also lost saved desktops

- J504-027 Bug in implementation of Gtk.Icon_View.Get_Model
  Problem:    Calling this function might cause a Gtk_Critical error or
              memory corruption.
  Workaround: Avoid calling this function, or manually change line 296 to
              "return Gtk_Tree_Model (Get_User_Data (M, Stub));"
