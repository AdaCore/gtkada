Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.14.1

- I128-040 Wrong code generated with GUI builder for signal
  Problem:    When using the GUI builder to define signals, wrong code might
              be generated, with calls to "Object_Connect" appearing in the
              Initialize procedure before all widgets are initialized.
  Workaround: Move manually the calls to Object_Connect to the end of the
              Initialize procedure.

- I116-034 Building problem with File Chooser Dialog
  Problem:    When building with the project mechanim, the package for the
              file chooser dialog is not found by the compiler.
  Workaround: Add mention of gtkada-file_chooser_dialog.ad[sb] in
              <prefix>/lib/gnat/gtkada/gtkada.lgpr

Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.12.0

- H421-008 GtkAda static library support broken on Windows.
  Problem:    It is not possible to use the GtkAda project file to build a
              application linked statically with GtkAda on Windows. This is
              because the libgtkada.a library is specified using an hard
              coded path into the project file.
  Workaround: Build the application manually or edit lib/gnat/gtkada.gpr to
              fix the offending path.
