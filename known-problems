Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.22.0

- JA07-011 GtkAda.MDI.Raise_Child and floating windows
  Problem:    When a window is floating and Raise_Child is called, the
              window is not systematically made visible if you ask not
              to give the focus.
  Workaround: see Give_Focus to True when calling Raise_Child
