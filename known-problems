Known problems fixed in GtkAda 3.8.2


- MA02-035 Bad binding of glib's g_strfree_v

- Problem:    The chars_ptr_array access was defined as "in out" which resulted 
              in it being passed by reference by the GNAT compiler, and 
              resulted in memory corruption (glib trying to free wrong memory 
              adresses)
  Workaround: Pass the parameter as in

- M625-039 Redraw problems under Windows
  Problem:    Some items (like tree view expanders, buttons in toolbars)
              are not drawn or refreshed properly.
  Workaround: None known.

- M212-027 Link errors under Windows
  Problem:    When linking a GtkAda program under Windows, an error is raised
              about a missing -lgtk-win32-3.0/-lgdk-win32-3.0
  Workaround: In the directory <gtkada_install_dir>\lib\, copy
              libgdk-3.dll.a and libgtk-3.dll.a respectively to
              libgdk-win32-3.0.dll.a and libgtk-win32-3.0.dll.a. 
              And in the directory <gtkada_install_dir>\bin, copy
              libgdk-3.dll and libgtk-3.dll respectively to 
              libgdk-win32-3.0.dll and libgtk-win32-3.0.dll.

- M617-010 Incorrect binding for Gtk.Widget.Add_Accelerator
  Problem:    The type for Key is incorrect
  Workaround: Replace the type with Gdk_Key_Type

- M110-027 Incorrect binding for Gtk.Tree_Selection.Get_Selected
  Problem:    The new implementation for this function is not backward
              compatible, and when there is no actual selection will return
              uninitialized values.
  Workaround: Use Gtk.Tree_Selection.Count_Selected_Rows to verify that there
              is indeed a selection before calling Get_Selected.

- L615-005 Constraint Error using the GtkAda.Canvas
  Problem:    The GtkAda.Canvas might raise a Constraint_Error when moving

  Workaround: None known.

- JC10-011 Gtkada.MDI gives focus when raising a window
  Problem:    When selecting a floating window via the /Window
              menu, there were a number of cases where the window was
              not properly raised (depending on your window manager and
              system). The MDI will now additionally give the text focus
              to that window.
  Workaround: Call Raise_Child manually to make sure the window was raised

- JC09-041 Gtk.Widget.Get_Snapshot fails and causes crashes
  Problem:    Calling Gtk.Widget.Get_Snapshot causes memory corruption and
              potentially crashes.
  Workaround: Fix the binding to Get_Snapshot: parameter Clip_Rect should be
              a Gdk.Rectangle.Gdk_Rectangle_Access rather than 
              a Gtk.Rectangle.Gdk_Rectangle.
