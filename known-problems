Known problems fixed in GtkAda 2.2.1

- Wrong code generated by gate for combo boxes (C923-002)
  Problem:    If a combo box is added to the GUI, a Storage_Error will happen
              when the application is started
  Workaround: Remove the lines creating the internal widgets from the generated
              sources

- Incorrect handling of GtkTextBuffer signals (C923-002)
  Problem:    If a "changed" signal is set on a GtkTextView, it really should
              be connected to the buffer instead.
  Workaround: Add a call to Get_Buffer in the call to Connet, and make sure
              the callback expected a Gtk_Text_Buffer instead of a
              GtkTextView

- Wrong code generated by gate for progress bars
  Problem:    When creating with glade a progress bar with a fraction of 0.0,
              the code generated contains '0' which does not compile.
  Workaround: Specify 0.01 instead, or edit the generated code.
