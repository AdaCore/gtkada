.. _Transitioning_from_GtkAda_2_to_GtkAda_3:

***************************************
Transitioning from GtkAda 2 to GtkAda 3
***************************************

General
=======

GtkAda 3.x is a binding to the C library gtk+ 3.x. This is a major
release, with several incompatible changes. Most of those incompatibilities
are due to major changes in the C library. Mostly, the gtk+ developers
have performed a general cleanup, removing old types and subprograms that
were rarely used and belong to more specialized libraries.

They have also made significant changes in the internals of the library.
A lot of these changes should not impact typical user code, although they
will if you are writting your own container widgets.

The gtk+ developers have documented various things that will likely need
to be changed in user applications. The page at
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.3/gtk-migrating-2-to-3.html provides a
migration guide. Its code samples are in C, but should be applicable to
Ada quite easily.

GtkAda itself has also undergone its own changes. One of the most
significants is that most of the binding is now automatically generated
from XML files provided by the gtk+ developers. This ensures that the
binding is much more complete than it was before, and will be much
easier to evolve when new releases of gtk+ are made available.

It also means that users can, theoritically at least, automatically bind
a number of libraries from the gtk+/GNOME ecosystem. The automatic
generation relies on XML files, called GIR files from their ``.gir``
extension. If you wish to parse other files, you should likely modify
the toplevel Makefile (the ``generate`` target), as well as the file
:file:`contrib/data.py` to list which types should be bound. We do not
necessarily encourage you to generate your own bindings, and this
generation is likely to be more than just modifying one or two files...

Interfaces
----------

One other advantage of the automatic generation is that it allows us
to provide more advanced feature in the binding.

For instance, gtk+ has the notion of interfaces (which play a similar
role to Ada05 interfaces).

In GtkAda interfaces no longer require an explicit "with" of the interface
package, and a cast to the interface type (with "-" and "+"). Instead,
each package now contains the list of subprograms inherited from the
various interfaces.

So basically, all subprograms inherited from an interface become
available as primitive operations in the types that implement the interface.

We also expect to simplify the handling of signals and signal handlers.

Ada 2005
--------

GtkAda 3 makes use of Ada 2005 and requires GtkAda applications
to be compiled in Ada 2005 or Ada 2012 mode (e.g. using the -gnat05 or
-gnat2012 switch).

This makes it possible to use the object-dotted notation when calling
primitive operations. For instance, the following code::

    Gtk.Window.Set_Default_Size (Window, 800, 600);

can be replaced with::

    Window.Set_Default_Size (800, 600);


Pango
=====

Pango.Font
----------

The type ``Pango_Font_Metrics`` is now declared in its own package ``Pango.Font_Metrics.``

The type ``Pango_Font_Face`` is now declared in its own package ``Pango.Font_Face.``

The type ``Pango_Font_Family`` is now declared in its own package ``Pango.Font_Family.``

The type ``Pango_Language`` is now declared in its own package ``Pango.Language.``


Glib
====

Glib.Object
-----------

``Initialize_Class_Record``'s profile was changed to follow more closely what
is done for C applications. The previous implementation prevented applications
from implementing interfaces because some internal gtk+ data had to be
initialized too early. See ``glib-object.ads`` for an extensive documentation.

Glib.G_Icon
-----------

This type is now a ``GType_Interface.``
Instead of using ``Null_G_Icon,`` use ``Glib.Types.Null_Interface.``


Gdk
===

Gdk.Bitmap
----------

This package has been removed: ``Cairo`` packages should be used for drawing, and
``Gdk.Pixbuf`` for representing image data in memory.

Gdk.Color
---------

``Alloc`` no longer exists, and is not necessary since all drawing is now done
internally using ``Cairo`` which directly manipulates red/green/blue.

Gdk.Cursor
----------

The ``Gdk_New`` function working on ``Gdk_Pixmap`` has been removed. Use
``Gdk.Pixbuf.Gdk_New_From_Pixbuf`` to create a cursor from a pixbuf.

The ``Gdk_New`` function working on a ``String`` has also been removed.

A ``Gdk_Cursor`` is now derived from a ``Glib.Object.`` This has little
impact on programs, except that ``Null_Cursor`` can be replaced simply
by "null".

``Destroy`` was removed, and should be replaced with ``Unref.``

Gdk.Dnd
-------

The functions for handling ``Drag_Contexts`` have been moved to new package
``Gdk.Drag_Contexts.``

The ``Gdk_Drag_Context`` itself now inherits from ``GObject,`` which means that it no
longer requires its own ``Ref/Unref`` functions.

``Drag_Find_Window`` has been removed, use ``Drag_Find_Window_For_Screen`` instead.

``Drag_Get_Protocol`` has been replaced with ``Drag_Context_Get_Protocol.``

Gdk.Drawable
------------

All ``Draw_*`` subprograms have been removed: use ``Cairo`` for low-level drawing.

The type ``Gdk_Drawable`` no longer exists.

Gdk.Event
---------

A lot of the getters (and all of the setters) were removed. Instead, the
``Gdk_Event`` type fields can now be edited directly. This is slightly more
efficient, and more importantly better documents which fields are valid for
which event types.

The APIs to ``Get_Message_Type,`` ``Set_Message_Type,`` ``Get_Data,`` and ``Set_Data`` have
been removed without replacement.

``Get_Graphics_Expose`` and ``Send_Client_Message`` have been removed with no
replacement.

``Deep_Copy`` was removed. It is now possible to simply use ":-" on the record
type itself.

``Get`` and ``Peek`` are now functions instead of procedures with a single out
parameter.

``Is_Created`` has been removed (you can compare with null)
``Send_Client_Message_To_All`` has been removed (deprecated in gtk+)

``Allocate`` has been removed. ``Instead,`` users should directly use
``Gdk.Event.Gdk_New`` and set the appropriate fields.

``Get_X`` and ``Get_Y`` were replaced by ``Get_Coords.``
``Get_X_Root`` and ``Get_Y_Root`` were replaced by ``Get_Root_Coords``

``Get_Button,`` ``Get_State,`` ``Get_Key_Val`` and ``Get_Keycode`` were kept (so you do not
have to directly access the field of ``Gdk_Event).`` ``However,`` they no longer raise
an exception if you pass them an invalid event type, but return an out-of-range
value.

Gdk.Font
--------

This package has been removed: use ``Pango.Font`` for fonts manipulation,
``Cairo.Font_Face`` and ``Cairo.Font_Options`` for text rendering.

Gdk.GC
------

This package has been removed: ``Cairo`` packages should be used for drawing.

Gdk.Image
---------

This package has been removed: use a ``Gdk.Pixbuf`` instead.

Gdk.Main
--------

``Set_Locale`` functions are no longer needed and have been removed.

Functions ``Set_Use_Xshm`` and ``Get_Use_Xshm`` have been removed.

Gdk.Pixbuf
----------

``Render_Threshold_Alpha,`` ``Render_To_Drawable,`` ``Render_To_Drawable_Alpha,``
``Render_Pixmap_And_Mask,`` ``Render_Pixmap_And_Mask_For_Colormap`` have been removed.

Use APIs provided by ``Gdk.Cairo`` to draw a pixbuf on a ``Gdk_Drawable.``

``Get_From_Drawable`` has been removed, use ``Get_From_Surface`` or ``Get_From_Window.``

Gdk.Pixmap
----------

This package has been removed: ``Cairo`` packages should be used for drawing, and
``Gdk.Pixbuf`` for representing image data in memory.

Gdk.Region
----------

This package has been removed and replaced with ``Cairo_Region.``

Gdk.RGB
-------

This package is deprecated in gtk3. Use ``Pixmaps/Cairo`` for drawing, and
use ``Gdk.Pixbuf`` for offscreen image manipulation and rendering to drawables.

Instead of ``Gdk.Rgb.Get_Cmap,`` use ``Gtk.Widget.Get_Default_Colormap.``

Gdk.Window
----------

A ``Gdk_Window`` now derives from ``GObject.`` This is mostly transparent for
applications, unless you are passing a ``Gdk_Window`` directly to C code,
in which case you must use ``Get_Object()`` on it.

``Copy_Area`` and ``Set_Back_Pixmap`` have been removed: use ``Gdk_Drawable`` and
``Gdk.Cairo`` functions instead.

``Clear_Area`` and ``Clear_Area_E`` were removed. Use ``Cairo`` for all drawings.

``Get_Desk_Relative_Origin:`` this function has been removed without a replacement.

``Get_Toplevels`` has been removed, use ``Gtk.Window.List_Toplevels`` instead.

``Set_Hints`` has been removed.  Depending on what you are trying to do, use
``Gtk.Window.Resize,`` ``Gtk.Window.Set_Size_Request,`` ``Gtk.Window.Move,``
``Gtk.Window.Parse_Geometry,`` and ``Gtk.Window.Set_Geometry_Hints.``

``Window_At_Pointer`` was renamed to ``At_Pointer.``

``Get_Origin`` is now a procedure, because the return value had no meaning anyway.

``Get_Geometry:`` no longer returns the color depth of the window, which is no
longer relevant to gtk+.

The first parameter of the various methods was renamed "``Self"`` instead of
"window" to avoid a number of cases where we would end up with duplicate
parameter names.

Gdk.Window_Attr
---------------

Parameter "``Colormap"`` has been removed from procedure ``Gdk_New.`` This parameter
 is no longer needed.

``Set_Colormap`` and ``Get_Colormap`` should no longer be needed and have been removed
as well.

Gtk
===

.. highlight:: ada

Gtk.Action
----------

``Block_Activate_From,`` ``Unblock_Activate_From,`` ``Connect_Proxy,`` ``Disconnect_Proxy:``
these obsolete subprograms have been removed without a replacement.

``Get_Action`` has been removed without a replacement.

``Convert`` has been removed, use ``Glib.Object.Get_User_Data`` instead.

Gtk.Aspect_Frame
----------------

``Direct`` accessors ``Get_Xalign,`` ``Get_Yalign`` and ``Get_Ratio`` have been removed:
use the corresponding properties instead.

Gtk.Assistant
-------------

The values in ``Gtk_Assistant_Page_Type`` were renamed for consistency,
removing their ``Gtk_`` prefix.

The package ``Generic_Assistant_Functions`` has been renamed to
``Set_Forward_Page_Func_User_Data.``

Gtk.Builder
-----------

``Add_From_File`` now returns a ``Guint`` and the error as a parameter.

``Get_Widget`` has been removed (use ``Get_Object`` instead, and cast to the appropriate
type)

Gtk.Button_Box
--------------

``Set_Child_Size`` was removed. Equivalent behavior can only be done by
changing the theme properties child-min-width and child-min-height.

Gtk.Cell_Layout
---------------

``Get_Cell_Renderers`` has been renamed to ``Get_Cells.``

Gtk.Cell_Renderer
-----------------

The ``Render`` subprogram is now called with a ``Cairo_Context`` rather than a
``Gdk_Window.``

Gtk.Cell_View
-------------

``Get_Cell_Renderers`` is obsolete, use the ``Gtk.Cell_Layout`` interface and
``Gtk.Cell_Layout.Get_Cells.``

Gtk.Clist
---------

This widget has been removed: use a ``Gtk.Tree_View`` instead.

Gtk.Container
-------------

Procedure ``Propagate_Expose`` has been removed and will be replaced with
``Propagate_Draw.``

``Class_Find_Child_Property,`` ``Class_list_Child_Properties`` and
``Class_Install_Child_Property`` are no longer bound.

``Children`` was removed (use ``Get_Children`` instead).

Gtk.Color_Button
----------------

The function ``Get_Color`` returning ``Gdk.Color.Gdk_Color`` is now a procedure
with an out parameter.

Gtk.Color_Selection
-------------------

``Get_Color`` and ``Set_Color`` have been removed: use ``Get_Current_Color`` and
``Set_Current_Color`` instead.

Gtk.Color_Selection_Dialog
--------------------------

Subprogram ``Get_Colorsel`` has been renamed ``Get_Color_Selection,`` to match
the ``Gtk+`` naming.

``Get_OK_Button,`` ``Get_Cancel_Button,`` ``Get_Help_Button`` have been removed.
Instead, use::

   Gtk_Button (Glib.Properties.Get_Property (Dialog, Ok_Button_Property)),
   Gtk_Button (Glib.Properties.Get_Property (Dialog, Cancel_Button_Property)),
   Gtk_Button (Glib.Properties.Get_Property (Dialog, Help_Button_Property))

Gtk.Combo
---------

This widget has been removed: use a ``Gtk.Combo_Box`` instead.

Gtk.Combo_Box
-------------

The "text only" variant has been moved to the new package ``Gtk.Combo_Box_Text.``

Gtk.Combo_Box_Entry
-------------------

This widget has been removed: use a ``Gtk.Combo_Box`` instead.

Gtk.Clipboard
-------------

The base type is now a ``GObject_Record`` instead of an opaque type: use the
``GObject`` facilities for lifecycle management.

There are now separate "``User_Data"`` generic version for callback-based methods.

Gtk.Ctree
---------

This widget has been removed: use a ``Gtk.Tree_View`` instead.

Gtk.Curve
---------

This widget has been removed, with no direct replacement.  Use drawing
functionality from ``Cairo`` instead.

Gtk.Dialog
----------

Subprogram ``Get_Vbox`` was replaced with ``Get_Content_Area.``

Subprogram ``Set_Has_Separator`` has been removed: use the corresponding flag
in the call to ``Gtk_New/Initialize`` instead.

Gtk.Dnd
-------

``Source_Set_Icon`` has been removed: use ``Source_Set_Icon_Pixbuf`` instead.
``Set_Icon_Pixmap`` has been removed: use ``Set_Icon_Pixbuf`` instead.

Obsolete ``Set_Default_Icon`` working on ``Gdk.Pixmap`` has been removed without a replacement.

Gtk.Editable
------------

The type representing a ``Gtk_Editable_Record`` has been changed from a
``Widget`` (which is a ``GObject)`` to an interface (a ``System.Address).``
Therefore the ``Gtk_Editable_Record`` type has been eliminated.  User code
referencing only the ``Gtk_Editable`` type should function unchanged.

Code using the tag as a test before converting a widget to a ``Gtk.Editable``
can now work using the ``Implements_Editable`` package.

For instance, if ``Widget`` is a ``GObject_Record,`` the following code::

      if Widget.all in Gtk_Editable_Record'Class then
         Cut_Clipboard (Gtk_Editable (Widget));

becomes::

      if Is_A (Widget.Get_Type, Gtk.Editable.Get_Type) then
         Cut_Clipboard`` (+Widget);

where the function "+" is defined by instantiating ``Implements_Editable``::

   package Implements_Editable is new Glib.Types.Implements
     (Gtk.Editable.Gtk_Editable, GObject_Record, GObject);
   function "+"
     (Widget : access GObject_Record'Class)
      return Gtk.Editable.Gtk_Editable
      renames Implements_Editable.To_Interface;

The ``Select_Region`` subprogram parameter name ``The_End`` has been normalized
to ``End_Pos``.

Gtk.Entry_Completion
--------------------

The "match-selected" and "cursor-on-match" signals were erroneously
given the internal filter model instead of the users model. This oversight
has been fixed in GTK+ 3; if you have handlers for these signals, they
will likely need slight adjustments. 

Gtk.Enums
---------

The following types were removed::

  ``GtkAnchorType``
  ``GtkCurveType``
  ``GtkMetricType``
  ``GtkGridLines``
  ``GtkUpdateType``
  ``GtkVisibility``
  ``GtkSideType``
  ``GtkMatchType``
  ``GtkPreviewType``
  ``GtkSubmenuDirection``
  ``GtkSubmenuPlacement``
  ``GtkTreeViewMode``

``Gtk_Icon_Size`` is no longer an enumeration type, but an integer, so that
new sizes can be defined through ``Gtk.Icon_Factory.Icon_Size_Register``.

Gtk.File_Chooser_Button
-----------------------

Subprograms ``Gtk_New_With_Backend`` and ``Initialize_With_Backend`` have been
removed: use ``Gtk_New`` and ``Initialize`` instead.

Gtk.File_Chooser_Dialog
-----------------------

Subprograms ``Gtk_New_With_Backend`` and ``Initialize_With_Backend`` have been
removed: use ``Gtk_New`` and ``Initialize`` instead.

Gtk.File_Chooser_Widget
-----------------------

Subprograms ``Gtk_New_With_Backend`` and ``Initialize_With_Backend`` have been
removed: use ``Gtk_New`` and ``Initialize`` instead.

Gtk.File_Selection
------------------

This package has been replaced by ``Gtk.File_Chooser.``
You may also use ``Gtkada.File_Selection`` for a simple interface to the
``Gtk.File_Chooser.``

Gtk.Fixed
---------

Subprograms ``Set_Has_Windows`` and ``Get_Has_Windows`` are now in ``Gtk.Widget.``

Gtk.Gamma_Curve
---------------

This widget has been removed without any replacement.

Gtk.GC
------

This package has been removed: ``Cairo`` packages should be used for drawing.

Gtk.GEntry
----------

The names for ``Gtk_Entry_Record`` parameters have been normalized across
the board to "``The_Entry".``

``Append_Text`` has been removed: use ``Set_Text`` and ``Get_Text`` instead.

Gtk.GRange
----------

``Set_Update_Policy`` has been removed, with no replacement. If you require
delayed updates, you will need to code it yourself.

Gtk.Handle_Box
--------------

This package is now marked as deprecated in C, and is likely to be removed
in future versions of gtk+, so we encourage you to stop using it as well.

Gtk.HRuler
----------

This widget has been removed without any replacement.

Gtk.Icon_Factory
----------------

``Gtk_Icon_Set`` and ``Gtk_Icon_Source`` have been moved to their own packages.
``Functions`` ``Gtk_New`` are now procedures.

Gtk.Image
---------

The subprograms working with ``Gdk_Pixmap`` have been removed, use the
variants working on ``Gdk_Pixbuf`` instead.

Gtk.Image_Menu_Item
-------------------

All controlling parameters were renamed to ``Self``. There was no consistency
before.

``Gtk_New_From_Stock`` now requires an ``Accel_Group`` parameter, which can be set to
null.

Gtk.Input_Dialog
----------------

This package is no longer part of gtk+, so this binding has been removed
without replacement.

Gtk.Item
--------

This obsolete package has been removed with no replacement.

Gtk.Item_Factory
----------------

This obsolete package has been removed in favor of ``Gtk.UI_Manager.``

Gtk.Layout
----------

``Get_Width`` and ``Get_Height`` have been removed, use ``Get_Size`` instead.

Gtk.Link_Button
---------------

All widget parameter names have been normalized to "``Self".``

The ``Set_Uri_Hook`` function has been eliminated, and along with it the
``Uri_Func`` type and the ``Generic_Uri_Hook`` package.  ``Register`` a callback
for the button's "clicked" signal instead.

Gtk.List_Item
-------------

This widget has been removed: use a ``Gtk.Tree_View`` instead.

Gtk.Main
--------

``Do_Event`` was renamed ``Main_Do_Event.``

``Grab_Add`` and ``Grab_Removed`` are available in ``Gtk.Widget`` (as was already
 the case with gtk2).

The ``Quit`` package has been removed without replacement.

The ``Idle`` and ``Timeout`` handling been removed: use equivalent functions in
package ``Glib.Main`` instead.

Gtk.Menu
--------

``User_Menu_Popup`` has been replaced by ``Popup_User_Data.``

The version of ``Popup`` was took an access to ``C_Gtk_Menu_Positon_Func`` has
been removed. If you need to pass ``User_Data`` to the callback, you need to
instantiate the package ``Popup_User_Data.`` Note that in this package the
position of the ``Data`` parameter has changed.

Gtk.Menu_Item
-------------

For subprogram ``Set_Right_Justified,`` the parameter "``Justify"`` has been
renamed to "``Right_Justified".``

The obsolete procedures ``Remove_Submenu,`` ``Set_Right_Justify,`` and
``Right_Justify`` have been removed.  Instead, use ``Set_Submenu``,
``Set_Right_Justified,`` or ``Set_Right_Justified`` with ``Justify-True,``
respectively.

Calling ``Gtk_New`` with one ``Menu_Item`` argument has the same effect now
as before.  However, from this version on, if a ``Label`` argument exists
(even if set to ""), a ``Gtk_Label`` child will be created with the given
value.

Gtk.Menu_Tool_Button
--------------------

``Set_Arrow_Tooltip`` has been removed, use ``Set_Arrow_Tooltip_Markup`` or
``Set_Arrow_Tooltip_Text`` instead.

Gtk.Notebook
------------

``Get_Children`` has been removed: call ``Gtk.Container.Get_Children`` instead.

``Set_Tab_Label_Packing`` has been removed (this is left under control of the
theme).

``Set_Page`` has been removed, use ``Set_Current_Page`` instead.

``Insert_Page`` now returns the number of the page that has been inserted.

Gtk.List
--------

This package has been removed: use a ``Gtk_Tree_View`` instead.

Gtk.Object
----------

``Gtk.Object`` has been removed in gtk+-3.

The following subprograms and declarations are now in ``Gtk.Widget``::

    ``Flags``
    ``Unset_Flags``

    ``Floating``
    ``In_Destruction_Is_Set``

    ``Signal_Destroy``

The subprogram ``Gtk.Object.Sink`` has been removed: use ``Glib.Object.Ref_Sink``
 instead.

Gtk.Old_Editable
----------------

This obsolescent API has been removed, use ``Gtk.Editable`` where relevant.

Gtk.Option_Menu
---------------

``Gtk.Option_Menu`` has been removed.  Using ``Gtk.Combo_Box`` instead is
recommended.

Gtk.Pixmap
----------

This widget has been removed and is generally replaced with a ``Gtk.Image.``

Gtk.Preview
-----------

This widget has been removed without replacement.

Gtk.Print_Operation
-------------------

``Get_Status`` was renames to ``Get_Status_String`` when it returns a string, to
match the gtk+ API.

Gtk.Progress
------------

This widget has been removed without any replacement.

Gtk.Progress_Bar
----------------

This widget is now derived from ``Gtk.Widget`` directly, rather than from
``Gtk.Progress`` (which has been removed).

The enumeration type ``Gtk_Progress_Bar_Orientation`` has been removed,
and this widget now implements the ``Gtk_Orientable`` interface.  To fully
achieve the same functionality as the GtkAda 2.x ``Get_Orientation/``
``Set_Orientation`` subprograms, it is now necessary to call
``Get_Orientation/Set_Orientation`` along with ``Get_Inverted/Set_Inverted.``

Procedure ``Set_Pulse_Step's`` "``Step"`` parameter has been renamed to "``Formal."``

``Set_Ellipsize`` and ``Get_Ellipsize`` parameter names have been normalized
from "``Pbar"`` to "``Progress_Bar".``

If you intend to show text over the progress bar, you need to call
``Set_Text`` as before, but also call ``Set_Show_Text(True)``.

Gtk.Rc
------

This package is now mostly obsolete. The gtk+ library no longer supports
the :file:`*.rc` files, since it uses CSS-like files instead.

Gtk.Recent_Manager
------------------

The type ``Gtk_Recent_Info`` is now bound in its own package.

Gtk.Ruler
---------

This widget has been removed without any replacement.

Gtk.Settings
------------

``Properties`` are now named with the suffix "_Property". For instance,
``Gtk_Theme_Name`` is now ``Gtk_Theme_Name_Property.``

Gtk.Scale_Button
----------------

This package now conforms to the API conventions practiced throughout
the rest of the toolkit.  ``Gtk_New`` is implemented as a procedure rather
than as a function, and the use of ``GNAT.Strings.String_List`` replaces
``Gtkada.Types.Chars_Ptr_Array`` throughout.

Gtk.Selection
-------------

This package has been renamed ``Gtk.Selection_Data,`` for homogeneity with
the naming conventions.

``Gtk.Selection.Selection_Data`` is now called 
``Gtk.Selection_Data.Gtk_Selection_Data.``

Handling of ``Target_Lists`` has been moved to the new package ``Gtk.Target_List,``
along with ``Target_Entry_Array.``

The type ``Gtk_Target_Entry`` has been moved to the new package ``Gtk.Target_Entry.``

The way of obtaining the selection data from callbacks using the ``Args/GValues``
approach has changed, from::

      Data  : constant Gtk.Selection.Selection_Data :-
        Gtk.Selection.Selection_Data (Get_Proxy (Nth (Args, 2)));

to::

      Data  : constant Gtk.Selection_Data.Gtk_Selection_Data :-
        From_Object (Get_Address (Nth (Args, 2)));

The type ``Target_Flags`` has been moved to ``Gtk.Enums.Gtk_Target_Flags.``

The flag corresponding to ``Target_No_Constraint`` has been removed: use the
value 0 instead.

Gtk.Scrolled_Window
-------------------

``Set_Policy's`` parameters were renamed to ``Hscrollbar_Policy`` and
``Vscrollbar_Policy`` instead of ``H_Scrollbar_Policy`` and ``V_Scrollbar_Policy.``

Gtk.Socket / Gtk.Plug
---------------------

The binding for these two packages was removed. They are not portable
across platforms, and require access to the low-level X11 window ID,
for which we do not provide a binding.

Gtk.Status_Icon
---------------

``Status_Icon`` widget parameter names have been normalized to "``Status_Icon".``

``Get_Blinking`` and ``Set_Blinking`` have been removed, it is no longer possible to
make the status icon blink.

Gtk.Style
---------

All functions based on ``Gdk.GC`` or ``Gdk.Pixmap`` have been removed.
This package is deprecated (but not removed yet) in gtk3
Use functions in ``Gtk.Style_Context`` instead.

A number of drawing functions have been removed: use the ``Paint_*`` functions
instead.

``Replace`` a call to ``Get_Font`` with::

    with Gtk.Style_Context;  use Gtk.Style_Context;
    Get_Style_Context (Widget).Get_Font (Gtk_State_Flags_Normal);

Gtk.Text
--------

This obsolescent API has been removed: use a ``Gtk.Text_View/Gtk.Text_Buffer``
instead.

Gtk.Text_Attributes
-------------------

``Set_Fg_Stipple,`` ``Get_Fg_Stipple,`` ``Set_Bg_Stipple,`` ``Get_Bg_Stipple`` have been
removed without a replacement.

Gtk.Text_View
-------------

The functions ``Get/Set_Disable_Scroll_On_Focus`` have no effect in recent
versions of gtk+ and have been removed.

Gtk.Tree_Dnd
------------

This package was removed, and its contents split into ``Gtk.Tree_Drag_Source``
and ``Gtk.Tree_Drag_Source.``

The ```Drag_Dest_``` and ```Drag_Source_``` prefixes were removed from the subprogram,
so for instance ``Drag_Dest_Drag_Data_Received`` has become ``Drag_Data_Received.``

Gtk.Tree_Model
--------------

A ``Gtk_Tree_Model`` is now an interface (implemented by ``Gtk_List_Store``
and ``Gtk_Tree_Store),`` no longer a tagged type. It means that in callbacks
that receive a ``Gtk_Tree_Model`` parameter, you can no longer cast this
parameter to a ``Gtk_Tree_Store`` for instance. ``Instead,`` you need to do
the following::

       --  Model is the parameter, of type Gtk_Tree_Model
       Tree : constant Gtk_Tree_Store :- Gtk_Tree_Store (-Model);

``Gtk_New,`` for a ``Gtk_Tree_Path,`` are now procedures instead of functions,
to follow the usual GtkAda convention.

``Gtk_Tree_Row_Reference`` has been moved to its own package
``Gtk.Tree_Row_Reference.``

``Gtk_New`` and ``Gtk_New_First`` (for a tree path) now take a "out" parameter,
for consistency with the rest of the API.

Gtk.Tree_View_Column
--------------------

``Get_Cell_Renderers`` is obsolete, use the ``Gtk.Cell_Layout`` interface and
``Gtk.Cell_Layout.Get_Cells.``

Gtk.Tips_Query
--------------

This obsolete package has been removed.

Gtk.Tool_Item
-------------

``Set_Tooltip`` has been removed: use ``Set_Tooltip_Text`` and ``Set_Tooltip_Markup``
instead.

Gtk.Toolbar
-----------

All ``Gtk_Toolbar`` widget parameter names have been normalized to "``Toolbar".``

``Subprograms`` ``Append_*,`` ``Prepend_*`` and ``Insert_*`` have been removed: use ``Insert``
instead.

``Subprograms`` ``Get_Tooltips/Set_Tooltips`` have been removed.  Use the
``Gtk_Enable_Tooltips`` property instead.

Gtk.Tooltips
------------

The package ``Gtk.Tooltips`` has been removed, in favor of ``Gtk.Tooltip.``

For creating simple tooltips on all GtkAda widgets, the easiest is to use
``Gtk.Widget.Set_Tooltip_Text`` or ``Gtk.Set_Tooltip_Markup.`` See the example
in testgtk/create_tooltip.adb.

Gtk.Tree_View
-------------

``Procedure`` ``Create_Row_Drag_Icon`` now returns a ``Cairo_Surface.``

``Get_Hadjustment,`` ``Set_Hadjustment,`` ``Get_Vadjustment,`` ``Set_Vadjustment`` have been
removed: use the equivalent properties.

``Widget_To_Tree_Coords`` and ``Tree_To_Widget_Coords`` have been removed: use
``Convert_Widget_To_Tree_Coords`` and ``Convert_Tree_To_Widget_Coords.``

Gtk.VRuler
----------

This widget has been removed without any replacement.

Gtk.Widget
----------

The old ``Draw`` function no longer exists, and should be replaced with calls
to ``Queue_Draw_Area.`` ``However,`` a new ``Draw`` function was added with a different
profile and different semantic.

Function```Get_Snapshot`` has been removed. ``Draw`` should be used instead.

``Hide_All`` has been removed: use ``Hide`` instead.

``Set_Extension_Events`` and ``End_Extension_Events`` are no longer needed and have
been removed.

``Set_Colormap`` and ``Get_Colormap`` are no longer needed and have been removed.

``Set_Scroll_Adjustments`` has been removed without a replacement.

``Shape_Combine_Mask,`` ``Input_Shape_Combine_Mask`` and ``Reset_Shapes`` have been removed
without replacements.

``Set_Uposition`` has been removed: use the properties of the containing widget
to fix the position of contained widgets. The functions in ``Gtk.Window,`` for
instance ``Gtk.Window.Move,`` should be used for top-level widgets.

``Set_USize`` has been removed: use ``Set_Size_Request`` instead.

``Size_Request`` is now obsolescent. The recommend replacement is to use
``Get_Preferred_Width`` and ``Get_Preferred_Height.``

``Set_Default_Colormap,`` ``Get_Default_Colormap,`` ``Push_Colormap`` and ``Pop_Colormap`` were
removed. They are no longer needed, since all drawing is done through ``Cairo``
which doesn't use a colormap but directly the red/green/blue components.

``Queue_Clear`` and ``Queue_Clear_Area`` have been removed, call ``Queue_Draw`` and
``Queue_Draw_Area`` instead.

The signal "expose_event" no longer exists. It has been replaced with the
"draw" signal which provides a preconfigured ``Cairo_Context`` suitable for
the drawing (including the clip area that is used to speed up the rendering).

``Activate`` is now a function.

``Child_Focus:`` removed default value for ``Direction`` parameter
(was ``Dir_Tab_Forward)``

``Get_Allocation_Height`` and ``Get_Allocation_Width`` are now named
``Get_Allocated_Height`` and ``Get_Allocated_Width.``

``Get_Allocation_X`` and ``Get_Allocation_Y`` were removed, and can be accessed
through ``Get_Allocation.X`` and ``Get_Allocation.Y`` instead.

A lot of flags (``Can_Focus,`` ``Can_Default,...)`` now have explicit setters and
getters. This removed a number of subprograms, like::

   ``Double_Buffered_Is_Set`` (see ``Get_Double_Buffered)``
   ``Can_Focus_Is_Set`` (see ``Get_Can_Focus)``
   ``Mapped_Is_Set`` (see ``Get_Mapped)``
   ``Realized_Is_Set`` (see ``Get_Realized)``
   ``Has_Default_Is_Set`` (see ``Has_Default)``
   ``Has_Focus_Is_Set`` (see ``Has_Focus)``
   ``Has_Grab_Is_Set`` (see ``Has_Grab)``
   ``Rc_Style_Is_Set`` (see ``Has_Rc_Style)``
   ``In_Destruction_Is_Set`` (see ``In_Destruction)``
   ``Drawable_Is_Set`` (see ``Is_Drawable)``
   ``No_Window_Is_Set`` (see ``Has_Window)``

``Size_Allocate`` now takes an "in out" parameter for the allocation

``Set_Flags`` was renamed ``Set_State_Flags``
``Unset_Flags`` was renamed ``Unset_State_Flags``
``Flags`` and ``Flag_Is_Set`` must be replaced with a call to ``Get_State_Flags``

``Get_Child_Requisition`` is now a procedure with an in out parameter. It is
obsolescent.

``Default_Motion_Notify_Event`` was removed.

``Has_Default_Motion_Notify_Handler`` was removed.

``Get_Default_Visual`` was removed.

``Restore_Default_Style`` was removed (use ``Set_Style`` with a null parameter
instead).

``Class_Find_Style_Property,`` ``Class_List_Style_Properties`` and
``Class_Install_Style_Property`` were removed. ``They`` are mostly of interest
when writting theme engines.

``Class_Path`` and ``Path`` were replaced with ``Get_Path.``

``Allow_Shrink_Property`` and ``Allow_Grow_Property`` have been removed: use
 ``Get_Hexpand`` and ``Get_Vexpand`` instead.

``Render_Icon`` has been replaced by ``Render_Icon_Pixbuf.``

Gtk.Window
----------

``Set_Has_Frame,`` ``Get_Has_Frame,`` ``Set_Frame_Dimensions,`` ``Get_Frame_Dimensions:``
these special-purpose subprograms have been removed without replacement.

``Get_Gravity,`` ``Set_Gravity:`` these have been removed, use the property
``Gravity_Property`` instead.

``Resize`` no longer accepts parameters set to -1 to indicate the preferred
size of the window. This was a GtkAda extension, which can be achieved
using ``Get_Preferred_Size`` and passing the result to ``Size.``

``Group_Add_Window`` was renamed to ``Add_Window.``
``Group_Remove_Window`` was renamed to ``Remove_Window.``
``Group_List_Windows`` was renames to ``List_Windows.``

``Initialize`` now has the same default value for its ``The_Type`` parameter
as ``Gtk_New.``


GtkAda
======

Gtkada.MDI
----------

``Set_Dnd_Message`` no longer has a special handling for "#", which was
 used to indicate whether the window would be preserved or hidden when
 changing perspectives. Instead, a different color is used to highlight
 the target area (and this highlighting is now done using transparency).

Gtkada.Properties
-----------------

This package has been removed. It used to provide a dialog allowing you to
view and edit the properties of widgets in your application, live. This is
now provided directly by third parties through the GtkParasite tool.

Gnome
=====

Gnome.App_Bar
-------------

Subprogram ``Appbar_Get_Progress`` has been removed without replacement.

Gnome.Gentry
------------
