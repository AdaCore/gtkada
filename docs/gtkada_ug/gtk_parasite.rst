Using GtkParasite to inspect and modify running GtkAda applications
*******************************************************************

GtkParasite is a tool that enables one to inspect running Gtk+ applications. It’s usable with GtkAda application without any Ada specific recommendations.

It is disponible in a few Linux distributions, or you can install it from source. Here is the way to do that on unix platforms::

    # First get the source via cloning the git repository
    $ git clone git://github.com/chipx86/gtkparasite
    # or via downloading the tarball
    $ wget http://github.com/chipx86/gtkparasite/tarball/master -O - | tar xzf -
    
    $ cd gtkparasite
    
    # Make sure you have gtk development files installed before running this
    # Substitute the gtk version with 2.0 if you're using Gtk 2
    $ ./autogen.sh --with-gtk=3.0
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

When it is installed, you have to make sure that your application will be able to access GtkParasite library. This means either :

* Linking against the GtkParasite library during compilation of your application.
* Make sure that the dynamic library file is accessible at runtime, for example by adding its path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environnment variable before running your application.

Then, to run GtkParasite with your application::

    $ GTK_MODULES=gtkparasite yourapp
