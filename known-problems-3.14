KP-314-P411-032 Unable to launch glade

  Problem:    The glade executable does not launch, with messages of the form
              Unable to load image (Failed to open file
               '<some_path>/install/share/glade/pixmaps/plus.png':
                No such file or directory)

  Status:     This was fixed in GtkAda 17.0

  Workaround: Create a symlink from your GtkAda install to <some_path>.

KP-314-OC10-015 Memory leaks in *_foreach

  Problem:    In some cases, gtk+ functions accept some user data, but do not
              provide a way to know when it can be freed. This resulted in
              memory leaks. In some cases, we could fix the binding by freeing
              the no-longer needed user data. However, some functions no
              longer have a binding, since that would always lead to memory
              leaks. Here is the full list:
                 gtk.accel_group.find_user_data
                 gtk.builder.connect_signals_full_user_data
                 gtk.clipboard.request_contents_user_data
                 gtk.clipboard.request_image_user_data
                 gtk.clipboard.request_rich_test_user_data
                 gtk.clipboard.request_targets_user_data
                 gtk.clipboard.request_text_user_data
                 gtk.clipboard.request_uris_user_data
                 gtk.main.key_snooper_install_user_data
                 pango.attributes.filter_user_data

  Status:     This was fixed in GtkAda 17.0

  Workaround: If you were using these functions, consider storing the user
              data in a new tagged type derived from the widget. Most of the
              time this should be applicable.

KP-314-OB27-029 GtkProgressBar CSS styling not working

  Problem:    The -GtkProgressBar-min-horizontal-bar-height and
              -GtkProgressBar-min-vertical-bar-width CSS properties are not
              taken into account with Gtk 3.14 version. Hard-coded default
              values are used instead to define the progress bar's size, making
              it thin by default.

  Status:     This was fixed in GtkAda 17.0

  Workaround: None known.

KP-314-OB19-053 Wrong binding for Gtk.Tree_Store.Remove

  Problem:    The binding for this function set Iter to null, instead of
              setting it to a valid iter.

  Status:     This was fixed in GtkAda 17.0

  Workaround: None known.
