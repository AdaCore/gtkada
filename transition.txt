This document describes how to transition from GtkAda 2.x to GtkAda 3.x.

Gdk.Font
========

Metrics subprograms Get_Ascent and Get_Descent have been removed:
instead, use the corresponding functions in Pango.Font to get font
metrics.

Gdk.RGB
=======

This package is deprecated in Gtk3. Use Pixmaps/Cairo for drawing, and
use Gdk.Pixbuf for offscreen image manipulation and rendering to drawables.

Instead of Gdk.Rgb.Get_Cmap, use Gtk.Widget.Get_Default_Colormap.

Gtk.Aspect_Frame
================

Direct accessors Get_Xalign, Get_Yalign and Get_Ratio have been removed:
instead, use the corresponding properties.

Gtk.Color_Selection
===================

Get_Color and Set_Color have been removed: use Get_Current_Color and
Set_Current_Color instead.

Gtk.Color_Selection_Dialog
==========================

Subprogram Get_Colorsel has been renamed Get_Color_Selection, to match
the Gtk+ naming.

Get_OK_Button, Get_Cancel_Button, Get_Help_Button have been removed.
Instead, use:
   Gtk_Button (Glib.Properties.Get_Property (Dialog, Ok_Button_Property)),
   Gtk_Button (Glib.Properties.Get_Property (Dialog, Cancel_Button_Property)),
   Gtk_Button (Glib.Properties.Get_Property (Dialog, Help_Button_Property))

Gtk.Gamma_Curve
===============

This widget has been removed without any replacement.

Gtk.Layout
==========

Get_Width and Get_Height have been removed, use Get_Size instead.

Gtk.Object
==========

Gtk.Object has been removed in Gtk+-3.

The following subprograms and declarations are now in Gtk.Widget:

    Flags
    Unset_Flags
 
    Floating
    In_Destruction_Is_Set

    Signal_Destroy

The subprogram Gtk.Object.Sink has been removed: use Glib.Object.Ref_Sink
 instead.

Gtk.Text_View
=============

The functions Get/Set_Disable_Scroll_On_Focus have no effect in recent
versions of Gtk+ and have been removed.

Gtk.Tooltips
============

The package Gtk.Tooltips has been removed, in favor of Gtk.Tooltip.

For creating simple tooltips on all GtkAda widgets, the easiest is to use 
Gtk.Widget.Set_Tooltip_Text or Gtk.Set_Tooltip_Markup.
