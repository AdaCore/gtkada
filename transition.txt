This document describes how to transition from GtkAda 2.x to GtkAda 3.x.

Gtk.Object
==========

Gtk.Object has been removed in Gtk+-3.

The following subprograms and declarations are now in Gtk.Widget:

    Flags
    Unset_Flags
 
    Floating
    In_Destruction_Is_Set

    Signal_Destroy

The subprogram Gtk.Object.Sink has been removed: use Glib.Object.Ref_Sink
 instead.


Gtk.Tooltips
============

The package Gtk.Tooltips has been removed, in favor of Gtk.Tooltip.

For creating simple tooltips on all GtkAda widgets, the easiest is to use 
Gtk.Widget.Set_Tooltip_Text or Gtk.Set_Tooltip_Markup.
